"""
	This Python script is written by Zhiyang Ong to implement
		miscellaneous tasks.
	1) Add, commit, and push additions and updates to a Git repository.
	2) ???

	Synopsis:
	Perform miscellaneous tasks.


	#### IMPORTANT NOTES:
	#### IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS:
	A test suite for this Python module is not provided.
	This is because it would require a Python interface to Git in order
		to test if differences between the last build (or build *n*) and
		the previous last build (or build *n*-1) have been committed and
		pushed to the cloud-based Git repository.
		It involves checking for file additions and deletions, and file
			updates.
	I cannot simply and quickly write a test suite for this, so I have
		only tested this manually.


	Revision History:
	July 31, 2018			Version 0.1, initial build.
