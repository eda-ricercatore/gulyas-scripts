+ *docs*
	- Documentation for the scripts and programs in this working directory,
		which are produced by documentation generators.
+ *hyperspace_synthesizer*
	- The module that applies a logic function on a product string.

	- The collection of reference stochastic signals/processes, such as
		instantaneous random-telegraph-waves (RTW).
+ *spice_netlists*
	- *SPICE* netlists of the standard cells of the standard cell library that is based
		on noise-based logic.
+ *std-cell-libraries.md*
	- This document that describes the (current) working directory, its contents,
