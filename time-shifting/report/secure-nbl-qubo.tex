\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Any computation that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem \cite{Anjos2012} {\it \Huge Add more references for QUBO} can be carried out on an adiabatic quantum computer \cite{Tandon2017}.

There are three types of problems that we would like to solve using the {\it D-Wave 2000Q} quantum computer \cite{UniversitiesSpaceResearchAssociationStaff2015a}. Firstly, we propose a design solving the classic NP-complete problem, k- boolean/propositional satisfiability ($k$-SAT) problem, where $k > 2$. Secondly, we want to solve quantum- Merlin-Arthur$_{1}$ problems with quantum circuits. Lastly, we propose a quantum circuit to solve problems in maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT), pseudo-boolean optimization (PBO), and weighted boolean optimization (WBO) by formulating
