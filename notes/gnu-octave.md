##	Build Automation for *GNU Octave*

###	Using *Makefile* for Build Automation

For *Makefile*-based build automation for executing/running 
	*GNU Octave* scripts, I have to do the following:
+ ./[*filename*]
	- Requires adding the *UNIX* shebang for *GNU Octave*
	- Requires using *chmod* (*UNIX* command) to change the file
		permission, so that the script(s) can be executed via the
		Terminal as a *UNIX* command/process.

And avoid doing the following:
+ octave [*filename*]

Notes for using *Makefile* for build automation; that is, using *Makefile* to execute/run *GNU Octave* scripts:
+ Only the main script that would be called by the *Makefile*, or executed via the command line of the *Terminal* application, need to have its file permissions set by *chmod*.
+ The main script also needs to have the *UNIX* shebang in its first line.
+ Other scripts, containing a function per script, form a library of *GNU Octave* scripts.
+ The aformentioned library of *GNU Octave* scripts need not have the *UNIX* shebang in their first line.
+ The aformentioned library of *GNU Octave* scripts need not have their file permissions set by *chmod*.

Experimentally/Empirically demonstrated in the execution of the
	*Make* target *torture*. See: [link to sandbox/gnu-octave](../sandbox/gnu-octave).

















##	Functions

Each *GNU Octave* script can only contain one function.

If more than one function is defined in a script, all the functions
	(except the first function) cannot be recognized by other
	*GNU Octave* scripts. 

For a function-specific script:
+ The name of the function must match its file name.
+ The name of the function must match the name of the function
	used in a function call.
	- E.g., to call function *foo* in a script, the function
		specified in the file named *foo.m* must be named *foo*.  

When I make a function call, I can use more arguments than specified
	as function parameters.
	The extra arguments are ignored.


Experimentally/Empirically demonstrated in the execution of the
	*Make* target *torture*. See: [link to sandbox/gnu-octave](../sandbox/gnu-octave).

###	Handling Input Arguments/Parameters

The variable *nargin* stores the number of input arguments that are
	used in the function call.
	That is, when a function is called, *nargin* determines the
	number of input arguments in the function call
	\cite[\S11.2, pp. 173]{Eaton2016a}.
	
However, if *varargin* is specified as the last argument to a
		function, *nargin()* (or *nargin(function_name)*) would
		return a negative value \cite[\S11.2, pp. 173]{Eaton2016a}.


### Concepts Experimentally/Empirically Demonstrated, But Unrecorded

Concepts that are experimentally/empirically demonstrated, but not
	stored in the repository as commented code fragments:
+ Mismatch between the name of the specified function and the filename
	of the function-specific script is not allowed. 
+ Mismatch between function name used in a function call and the name
	of the specified function (in the function-specific script) is
	not allowed. 
+ If the number of arguments used in the function is less than the
	number of arguments specified in the function, an error will be
	raised in the execution of the script. 
	- **Example of creating an error.**
+ If a script file contains multiple functions, only the first
	function defined can be called.
	- The remaining functions can not be called.
	- Each unique function shall be specified in a unique file/filename.





###	Function files (and Script Files)

A function file (or script file) should only contain one function.




###	Function Handles, Anonymous Functions, and Inline Functions








##	Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG) in *GNU Octave*

To reset the seed of the function for pseudo-random number generation
	(PRNG), do the following: rand("seed","reset") 
	\cite[Function File: Function Reference -- rand]{OctaveForgeContributors2016}.
	
Note: Do not assign *rand("seed","reset")* to any variable. 
	This will cause an error in executing/interpreting the
	*GNU Octave* script, since this function does not return a value
	or matrix (or any other mathematical object).
+ **Example of creating an error.**















##	Error Management

*GNU Octave* does not have exceptions, which *C++* and *Java* have.

Instead, *GNU Octave* uses errors to terminate execution of the
	*GNU Octave* program, when abnormalities are detected. 

In addition, *GNU Octave* can also raise warnings about things that
	are undesirable, but not problematic such that the *GNU Octave* 
	program should terminate.
	If the program can still run or be completed correctly, warnings
	can be raised instead of throwing exceptions to terminate the
	program. 

###	Guidelines On Using Errors and Warnings

Error and warning messages can be used to judiciously inform the user
	of abnormal conditions \cite[\S12, pp. 205]{Eaton2016a}.

Adopt "a set of contractual guidelines" \cite{WikipediaContributors2016f}
	to support reasoning on errors, just like exception safety
	guarantees in *C++* 
	\cite{Abrahams1998,Abrahams2001,WikibooksContributors2016,WikipediaContributors2016f}.

In descending order of safety guarantees, the levels of exception
	safety (or rather, error safety) are \cite{Abrahams1998,Abrahams2001,WikibooksContributors2016,WikipediaContributors2016f}:
+ no throw guarantee, or failure transparency: "Best level of exception safety."
+ strong exception safety, commit/rollback semantics, or no-change guarantee
+ basic exception safety
+ minimal exception safety, no-leak guarantee
+ no exception safety: "No guarantees are made. (Worst level of exception safety)"  

These levels of error/exception safety can be partially handled, and the
	use of guards/invariants is strongly recommended for making the code
	exception safe.

In addition, judiciously consider what to do with the semipredicate
	problem \cite{WikipediaContributors2016e}.

### *unwind_protect* Technique \cite[\S10.8, pp. 168]{Eaton2016a}

+ Warnings cannot be handled by *unwind_protect*.
	- When a warning occurs, the *unwind_protect_cleanup* block can
		make corrections to (i.e., mitigate) the trigger of
		the warning.
	- The execution of the script does not terminate when warnings
		are generated in the *unwind_protect* block.
+ When no warning nor error is generated, the
	*unwind_protect_cleanup* block is executed anyway.
	- Cleanup of *unwind_protect* is executed regardless of whether
		errors/warnings are generated.
+ When an error is caught (and handled), the
	*unwind_protect_cleanup* block is executed before the
	program/script is terminated.
	- The remainder of the program, after the
		*unwind_protect_cleanup* block would not be executed. 
+ Only errors are handled with *unwind_protect*.

###	*try-catch-block* Technique \cite[\S10.9, pp. 168-169]{Eaton2016a}

+ Warnings cannot be caught.
+ Only errors are caught.
+ For normal operations that do not produce an error or warning,
	the catch block is not executed.

###	Raising Errors

The syntax for raising an error is: *error(id, template, ...)*
	\cite[\S12.1.1, pp. 205]{Eaton2016a}.  

The first argument *id* is: the value/number associated with the
	output stream
	\cite[\S12.1.1, pp. 205; \S14.1.3, pp. 242; \S14.1.1.1, pp. 236]{Eaton2016a}.

The second argument *template* is: the string containing the
	error message \cite[\S12.1.1, pp. 205; \S14.2.4, pp. 253]{Eaton2016a}..

A raised error would diplay an error message, which is stored in
	*template* (if *template* is not terminated by a newline
	character) or a "traceback of function calls leading to the
	error" \cite[\S12.1.1, pp. 205-206]{Eaton2016a}.

If *template* "does not end with a newline character, a traceback
	of function calls leading to the error" is printed in the
	standard error stream \cite[\S12.1.1, pp. 205-206]{Eaton2016a}.

If *template* ends with a newline character, the error message
	*template* is printed without the aforementioned traceback
	\cite[\S12.1.1, pp. 206]{Eaton2016a}. 

If *template* is "a null string ("")," the script/program would
	continue execution. The raised error would be treated as a
	NOP ("no operation") statement
	\cite[\S12.1.1, pp. 206]{Eaton2016a}.

	
###	Difficulties Faced

I cannot raise an error with an identifier. I have tried using
	a string or a number in vain.

After multiple errors are raised, I cannot increment the value of
	beep_on_error(), via beep_on_error(new_error_value).
Before an error occurs, the error value is zero.
Subsequently, it is raised to one.

I have problems using the onCleanup() correctly, without causing
	errors due to my poor understanding of its function arguments.
		 


###	Catching Specific Errors

Specific errors can be caught, if only one potentially error raising
	operation is placed within the *try* block.
While **lasterr** and **lasterror** can help me obtain information
	about it, if I assign that error to a name in the specification
	of the *catch* block, I can access information about that
	specific error later \cite[\S10.9, pp. 169]{Eaton2016a}.



### Default Error and Warning Messages

In \cite[\S12.2.1, pp. 214-218]{Eaton2016a}, a list of default warning messages from
	*GNU Octave* is provided. 

















## Debugging

Make use of the "built-in debugger" \cite[\S13, pp. 219]{Eaton2016a}
	while developing programs/scripts in *GNU Octave*.

Features of the "built-in debugger" include
	\cite[\S13, pp. 219]{Eaton2016a}: 
+ Interrupting the execution of the *GNU Octave* script at
	certain points (e.g., line number).
+ Interrupting the execution of the *GNU Octave* script during
	certain conditions.

When the execution of the *GNU Octave* script is interrupted, the
	["process", or execution of the program/script] switches (from
	the execution mode) into the debug mode.
This allows the symbol table at the point/condition of interruption
	to be examined, and modified for error location and correction
	\cite[\S13, pp. 219]{Eaton2016a}. 

**I am skipping the subsections on "Breakpoints" and "Call Stack"
	for the time being.**

###	Debug Mode Difficulties

I can enter the debug mode using *debug_on_interrupt()*, when I
	interrupt execution of the *GNU Octave* program/script using
	*Ctrl-C* on the *Terminal*.

However, I cannot enter the debug mode using warnings, or errors, yet.

###	Profiling

**I am skipping the subsection on "Profiling" for the time being.**















##	Data Types, Including Strings

`typeinfo(expr)` is used to determine the type of the
	expression `expr`, which is returned as a `string`.
"If `expr` is omitted," "a cell array containing all the currently"
	defined (and added) data types \cite[\S3, pp. 39]{Eaton2016a}.

`class(obj)` returns the class of the object `obj`
	\cite[\S3.1, pp. 39]{Eaton2016a}.
 
`class(s, id, p, ...)` creates a class with the fields of structure
	`s` and the name (string) `id`, and inherits
	attributes/properties and behavior (functions) 
	\cite[\S3.1, pp. 39]{Eaton2016a} [WikipediaContributors2016a].

`isa(obj, classname)` returns true if `obj` is an object of the
	class `classname` or the following class categories
	\cite[\S3.1, pp. 39-40]{Eaton2016a}: 
+ "float": 'double', or 'single'
+ "integer": (u)int8, (u)int16, (u)int32, and (u)int64
+ "numeric": either a floating point or integer value

If `classname` in `isa(obj, classname)` "is a cell array of string,"
	return a logical array (i.e., boolean array) of the same size.
The array would contain true for each class that `obj` belongs to
	\cite[\S3.1, pp. 40]{Eaton2016a}.

###	Numeric Constants

Forms of *numeric constants* \cite[\S4, pp. 47]{Eaton2016a}:
+ scalar
	- integer
	- decimal fraction
	- number in scientific/exponential notation
	- complex number
+ vector
+ matrix

By default, numeric constants are internally represented in
	*GNU Octave* "in double-precision floating point format," and
	complex constants are internally represented as "pairs of
	double-precision floating point values"
	\cite[\S4, pp. 47]{Eaton2016a}.

The imaginary part of a complex constant requires the `i` to be
	appended to the number representing the magnitude of the
	complex number, without white space between them
	\cite[\S4, pp. 47]{Eaton2016a}.

`double(x)` converts x to the data type with double-precision
	floating point format \cite[\S4, pp. 47]{Eaton2016a}.  

`complex(re,im)` returns the complex number *(re)* + *(im)*i.
	If the second input argument *(im)* is not provided, the
	result is a real number with the magnitude *(re)*
	\cite[\S4, pp. 47]{Eaton2016a}.








###	Built-in Data Types

List of built-in data types \cite[\S3 and \S3.1, pp. 39]{Eaton2016a}: 
+ real scalars
	- \cite[\S4.4, pp. 54-57]{Eaton2016a} provides a list of functions
		to deal with the *Integer* data type.
+ complex scalars
+ real matrices
+ complex matrices
+ ranges
	- A range is "a row vector with evenly spaced elements."
	- Its format is: *base*:*increment*:*limit*.
	- The increment is an optional number.
	- To turn a range into the *row vector* (i.e., matrix) data type,
		place the range within square brackets.
	- E.g., [*base*:*increment*:*limit*].
	- Note that if it is important to include the endspoints of
		range, and the number of elements is known, use the
		`linspace` function instead.
	- Note that the optional *increment* must be a non-zero number.
	- See \cite[\S4.2, pp. 52-53]{Eaton2016a}.
+ character strings (i.e., strings)
	- A character string is a "sequence of characters" enclosed
		in single- or double- quote marks.
		It is stored internally by *GNU Octave* as matrices of
		characters \cite[\S3.1.3, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}.
		See [script that determines the data type of various variables](../sandbox/gnu-octave/h-basic-operations.m).
+ struc, a data structure type:
	Currently, implemented as "an associative array with indices
	limited to strings" \cite[\S3.1.4, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}.
+ "an array that can contain all data types"
+ cell arrays
	- A "general array that can hold any number of" elements, which
		can be of any data type \cite[\S3.1.3, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}. 

Matrix objects are not limited by language-specific size constraints,
	"and can be dynamically reshaped and resized"
	\cite[\S3.1.1, pp. 42]{Eaton2016a}.
That said, there is a limit for "the maximum number of elements in
	a matrix."
This is determined by various factors, such as the size of the
	physical memory (or main memory) of my computer.
The value of this limit can be found via invoking the function
	`sizemax`.
Therefore, its returned value "is slightly smaller than" the
	theoretical maximum value reported by `intmax` (of the class
	`int64`) \cite[\S4.1, pp. 49]{Eaton2016a}.

The maximum and minimum values of "built-in floating-point
	numeric data," which are "currently stored as double precision
	numbers," are given by \cite[\S3.1.1, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}.:
+ `realmin`
+ `realmax`
+ `eps`

\S3.3 has a list of functions in *GNU Octave* to determine the size
	of objects.
That is, these functions determine the number of elements in that
	set of objects/elements, or the size of a given dimension of the
	matrix \cite[\S3.3, pp. 44-46]{Eaton2016a}.

Notes:
+ \cite[\S4.1, pp. 49-51]{Eaton2016a} has functions to modify the
	standard output display. E.g., the display of the elements of
	a huge matrix can be modified, so that it is more readable. 
	- See \cite[\S4.1.1, pp. 51-52]{Eaton2016a} to find out how to
		display huge empty matrices.
+ \cite[\S4.5, pp. 57-60]{Eaton2016a} provides a list of functions
	for bit manipulations.
+ \cite[\S4.6, pp. 60-61]{Eaton2016a} provides a list of functions
	for logical reasoning, based on boolean algebra.
+ \cite[\S4.8, pp. 62-65]{Eaton2016a} provides a list of predicates
	for numeric objects. These support run-time type checking.



### Developer-Defined Specialized Data Types

Specialized data types can be defined with some *C++* code 
	\cite[\S3, pp. 39]{Eaton2016a}.

Such code can be integrated into *GNU Octave*
	via \cite[\S3, pp. 39]{Eaton2016a}:
+ Recompiling *GNU Octave* to add the new data type(s).
+ Dynamically load the new data type(s) "while *GNU Octave*
	is running." 






###	Casting Into A Data Type
`cast(val, "type")` converts `val` in its current data type to the
	data type specified by `"type"` \cite[\S3.1, pp. 40]{Eaton2016a}.
	
The numeric classes that can be used for `val`
	are \cite[\S3.1, pp. 40]{Eaton2016a}:
+ "double"
+ "single"
+ "logical"
+ "char"
+ "int8"
+ "int16"
+ "int32"
+ "int64"
+ "uint8"
+ "uint16"
+ "uint32"
+ "uint64"

Note that this can change the value of `val`, so that its value
	can fit within the range of the data type `"type"`
	\cite[\S3.1, pp. 40]{Eaton2016a}.


###	Casting Into A Class

`y = typecast(x, "class")` interprets the data of `x` in memory as
	data of the numeric class `"class"`, and returns a new array `y`
	containing values from the interpretation
	\cite[\S3.1, pp. 40-41]{Eaton2016a}. 

The classes that `x` and `"class"` belong to are restricted to the
	following "built-in numeric classes"
	\cite[\S3.1, pp. 40-41]{Eaton2016a}:
+ "logical"
+ "char"
+ "int8"
+ "int16"
+ "int32"
+ "int64"
+ "uint8"
+ "uint16"
+ "uint32"
+ "uint64"
+ "double"
+ "single"
+ "double complex"
+ "single complex"





###	Missing Data Representation

Missing data can be explicitly represented in *GNU Octave* as
	`"NA(n,m,k, ...)"` and `"NA(class)"`.
These functions return a scalar, matrix, or N-dimensional array
	containing elements that "are all equal to the special constant
 	used to designate missing values `NA` (i.e., "Not Available").
When the input argument(s) of `"NA(n,m,k, ...)"` are/is
	\cite[\S3.1.2, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}:
+ empty (i.e., no input arguments), return the scalar value `NA`.
+ one (`n`), return a square matrix with the same dimensions as `n`.
+ >1 (`(n, m)` or `(n, m, k, ...)`), return a `i`-dimensional matrix,
	where the size/cardinality of the `j`th dimension is specificed
	by the `j`th input argument \cite[\S3.1.2, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}.

Note that the optional argument `class` in `NA(..., class)`
	specifies the return type as *"double"* or *"single"*
	\cite[\S3.1.2, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}.

Note that `NA != NA`, hence I could not compare the equality of	`NA`
	values using `==` or `!=`.
Instead, I should use the `isna(x)` function
	\cite[\S3.1.2, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}.

`isna(x)` returns a boolean array that indicates which elements of
	`x` are `NA` (missing) values. If `x[i]` is a `NA` value, then
	the `i`th element of the returned boolean array would indicate
	`true`; else, the `i`th element would return `false`
	\cite[\S3.1.2, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a}.




###	Strings

A string constant, or character string \cite[\S3.1.3, pp. 43]{Eaton2016a},
	[is composed of / contains / "consists of"] "a sequence of
	characters" that are enclosed in quotation
	(single/double quote(s)) \cite[\S5, pp. 67]{Eaton2016a}.

Essentially, its representation is an array (of a one-dimensional
	matrix) of characters, which are represented by their ASCII values
	in the array \cite[\S5.2, pp. 68]{Eaton2016a}.

By convention, each row of characters is a string in *GNU Octave*,
	while a column of such strings (of the same length) form a string
	array \cite[\S5.2, pp. 68]{Eaton2016a}.

In *GNU Octave*, a string is a character vector, rather than merely a
	character matrix.
	Hence, use the *`ischar(x)`* and *`isvector(x)`* functions to
	determine if a variable is a character array/matrix or a character
	vector \cite[\S5.2, pp. 68]{Eaton2016a}.

It is recommended to use double quotes to denote strings, since a
	single quote is used as the operator for matrix transpose 
	\cite[\S5, pp. 67]{Eaton2016a}.





####	String Creation and Concatenation

Use matrix notation to enable string concatenation;
	e.g., *`[string1, string2]`* (or *`[string1 string2]`*)  concatenates *string1* and *string2*
	together \cite[\S5, pp. 67]{Eaton2016a}.





####	Conversion Between Strings and Numerical Data

Conversion between strings and numerical data can be done by the
	following functions \cite[\S5.3.2, pp. 73-75]{Eaton2016a}:
+ *`mat2str(x,n)`*:
	- `mat2str(x,n, "class")`
+ *`num2str(x)`*:
	- *`num2str(x, precision)`*
	- *`num2str(x, format)`*
+ *`int2str(n)`*

*`sprinf(template, ...)`* provides more flexibility to display
	numerical data as strings. 


####	String Comparison

Functions for string comparison, which requires character by
	character comparison of strings (can't be done by using "=="), are:
+ *`strcmp(s1,s2)`*
+ *`strncmp(s1,s2,n)`*
+ *`strcmpi(s1,s2)`*
+ *`strncmpi(s1,s2,n)`*


####	String Manipulation

####	String Conversions

Functions for string conversions are found in 
	\cite[\S5.6, pp. 91-96]{Eaton2016a}.
	They convert between representations, such as ASCII, decimal,
	string (including left/right justification), binary, double,
	hexadecimal, single/double precision numbers/vector, and numbers
	of another base.
	They can also convert strings to upper case or lower case.
	In addition, they can convert between escape sequences/forms to
	their corresponding representations (as special characters).
+ *`bin2dec (s)`*
+ *`dec2bin (d, len)`*
+ *`dec2hex (d, len)`*
+ *`hex2dec (s)`*
+ *`dec2base (d, base)`*
+ *`dec2base (d, base, len)`*
+ *`base2dec (s, base)`*
+ *`s = num2hex (n)`*
+ *`n = hex2num (s)`*
+ *`n = hex2num (s, class)`*
+ *`str2double (s)`*
+ *`strjust (s)`*
+ *`strjust (s, pos)`*
+ *`x = str2num (s)`*
+ *`[x, state] = str2num (s)`*
+ *`toascii (s)`*
+ *`tolower (s)`*
+ *`lower (s)`*
+ *`toupper (s)`*
+ *`upper (s)`*
+ *`do_string_escapes (string)`*
+ *`undo_string_escapes (s)`*



####	Accessor Functions: Character Class Functions

Character class functions are a category of accessor functions that
	determine if a string array contains elements of a specific/given
	character class.
	That is, are the elements of the string alphanumeric, alphabetic,
	numeric (in decimal or hexadecimal), lower case, upper case,
	punctuation characters, whitespace characters, control characters,
	printable characters, or ASCII characters
	\cite[\S5.7, pp. 96-98]{Eaton2016a}:
+ *`isalnum (s)`*
+ *`isalpha (s)`*
+ *`isletter (s)`*
+ *`islower (s)`*
+ *`isupper (s)`*
+ *`isdigit (s)`*
+ *`isxdigit (s)`*
+ *`ispunct (s)`*
+ *`isspace (s)`*
+ *`iscntrl (s)`*
+ *`isgraph (s)`*
+ *`isprint (s)`*
+ *`isascii (s)`*


It also includes an accessor function to determine the charactes
	class property of a string; see *`isstrprop(str, prop)`*
	\cite[\S5.7, pp. 98]{Eaton2016a}.













###	Escape Sequences for Strings

With single-quoted strings, the backslash character is not treated as
	a special character \cite[\S5.1, pp. 67]{Eaton2016a}.

However, with double-quoted strings, the backslash character introduces
	an escape sequence to represent other characters, such as
	\cite[\S5.1, pp. 67-68]{Eaton2016a}:
+ backslash character, *literal representation* 
+ double-quote character, *literal representation*
+ single-quote character, *literal representation*
+ newline character
+ horizontal tab 










##	Information About The Workspace

For information about the workspace, including a list of defined variables
	and their properties, see \cite[\S7.3, pp. 127]{Eaton2016a}.










##	Data Containers and Data Structures

Two mechanism used by *GNU Octave* to contain arbitrary data types in
	a variable are \cite[\S6, pp. 99]{Eaton2016a}:
+ Structures:
	- "C-like."
	- "Indexed with named fields."
+ Cell arrays:
	- "Each element of the array can have a different data type annd/or
		shape."


###	Structures

A structure in *GNU Octave* is implemented as an associative array,
	which indices are limited to strings.
	Its syntax is similar to similar to structures in *C* (or "C-style
	structures") \cite[\S6.1, pp. 99]{Eaton2016a}. 


####	Structure Usage

To access/modify a field *f* of a structure *s*, concatenate the name
	of the structure with the name of the field with a period
	between them.
	E.g., *s.f* \cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 99]{Eaton2016a}.

The value of a structure can be printed on the console/terminal of
	*GNU Octave*, stating the structure's variable name would suffice.
	However, the order in which the fields are listed when printing
	a structure is random
	\cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 99]{Eaton2016a}.

The structure can be copied just like variables of data types.
	That is, its content would be copied into another variable
	\cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 99-100]{Eaton2016a}.

Structures are "treated" as values.
	Hence, fields/elements of a structure can "reference other
	structures" \cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 100]{Eaton2016a}.

Note that printing the value of a nested structure, which has
	structures embedded in a (i.e., top-level) structure, would only
	print the content of the first few-level (e.g., three) levels.
	The remaining embedded/nested levels are printed/represented as
	a struct array with its dimensions (but not content) specified
	\cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 100-101]{Eaton2016a}.

The *`function struct_levels_to_print()`* is used to determine or set
	the number of levels (of the nested structure) to print.
	*`val = struct_levels_to_print()`* is used to find out the
		number of levels (of the nested structure) to print. 
	*`old_val = struct_levels_to_print(new_val)`* is used to set the
		number of levels (of the nested structure) to print.
	*`struct_levels_to_print(new_val, "local")`* is used to set the
		number of levels (of the nested structure) to print locally,
		such that only the function and called subroutines are
		affected \cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 101]{Eaton2016a}.

Use the function *`print_struct_array_contents ()`* to determine or
	set the boolean flag that specifies whether to print the contents
	of the struct array.
	If the boolean flag is set to true, the contents of struct arrays
		would be printed \cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 101]{Eaton2016a}.
	*I have problems using the function
		`print_struct_array_contents ()` correctly.*


Structures can be returned by functions as their output
	\cite[\S6.1.1, pp. 101-102]{Eaton2016a}.

To enumerate all elements of a structure, use a special form of the
	*`for`* statement for a variable (named *`expression`*)
	\cite[\S10.5.1, pp. 165-166]{Eaton2016a}.

	for [val, key ] = expression
		body
	endfor








####	Structure Arrays

A structure array is a subset of structures, and each of its fields
	"is [be] represented by a cell array." 
	Since these cell arrays have the same dimensions, a structure
	array can also be recognized as an array of structures, where
	each of these structures has identifical field.
	Alternatively, index and print the field/element of the structure.
	That is, use the vectors as indices to the structure array.
	Similarly, elements of a structure array can be deleted by
	assigning them to an empty matrix
	\cite[\S6.1.2, pp. 103]{Eaton2016a}.


####	Structure Creation

Structures can be created using \cite[\S6.1.3, pp. 104]{Eaton2016a}:
+ the index operator *`.`*
+ the *`struc`* function
+ dynamic naming *`(var)`*, by using the variable's string value (or
	arbitrary string) as the field name



The string used in dynamic naming does not have to be a valid
	*GNU Octave* identifier.
	Note that *MATLAB* does not allow dynaming naming to use arbitrary
	strings \cite[\S6.1.3, pp. 104-105]{Eaton2016a}.


The *`struc`* function requires pairs of arguments
\cite[\S6.1.3, pp. 104-107]{Eaton2016a}.

##	Miscellaneous

###	Formatted Output

Conversion specifications \cite[\S14.2.4 Formatted Output]{Abbott2016}:
+ '%d': scalar argument, decimal notation
+ '%s': string argument
+ '%o': integer argument, octal radix
+ '%u': integer argument, decimal radix
+ '%x': integer argument, hexadecimal radix
+ '%c': character value 
+ '%f': fixed-point notation
+ '%e': exponential notation
+ '%g': fixed-point or exponential notation

For these aforementioned specific conversion specifications \cite[\S14.2.4 Formatted Output]{Abbott2016}:
+ Specific modifiers can be inserted between the percentage ("%") symbol and the character specifying/indicatingÂ the conversion type.
+ Specific flags can be inserted between the percentage ("%") symbol and the character specifying/indicatingÂ the conversion type.
+ These aforementioned flags and modifiers can be inserted between the percentage ("%") symbol and the character specifying/indicatingÂ the conversion type.  

### Terminal Output

To change the number of significant figures displayed in the terminal output, use the command *format[options]*, where the options are indicated as follows \cite[14.1.1 Terminal Output]{Abbott2016}:
+ *short*: Fixed point format with 5 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 10 characters wide. (default).
+ *long*: Fixed point format with 15 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 20 characters wide.



###	Block Comments

Block comments are enclosed "between matching '#{' and '#}' (or '%{' and '%}') markers" \cite[\S2.7.2, Block Comments, pp. 37-38]{Eaton2016a}

###	Continuation Lines \cite[\S10.10, pp. 169]{Eaton2016a}

By default, statements terminate with the newline character.

To continue a statement over multiple lines, use the ellipsis ("...")
	to list a fragment of a statement in a line that would be
	continued in the next line.

To continue a string over multiple lines, use the backslash ("\") to
	to list a fragment of a string in a line that would be
	continued in the next line.

Mathematical expressions that are contained within a pair of
	parentheses can be continued over multiple lines without using
	any continuation markers, such as the aforementioned ellipsis
	or backslash. 



















##	Compatibility with *Matlab*

For compatibility between *GNU Octave* and *Matlab*, see the section "Differences between Octave and MATLAB" [TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustinStaff2016].

Some information to note are [TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustinStaff2016]: 
+ Loading files
	- Use absolute path; use relative paths otherwise.
	- Files are loaded differently in *GNU Octave* and *Matlab*.
+ Use "C-style autoincrement and assignment operators" in *GNU Octave*
	but not in *Matlab*.
+ *GNU Octave* and *Matlab* have compute the product of
	boolean values differently.
	- *GNU Octave* usues "prod," and *Matlab* does not.
+ *GNU Octave* fucntions and variables that do not exist in *Matlab*:
	- nargin
+ *GNU Octave* allows an array of varying-length strings,
	while *Matlab* does not.
	
	*GNU Octave* enables left single quotes to surround a string, and 
		right single quotes to surround a string.
+ *GNU Octave* does not allow empty files to be loaded, but *Matlab*
	does allow empty files to be loaded.
+ *GNU Octave* allows *"printf"* to print a string to standard output,
	but *Matlab* does not; for *Matlab*, use *"printf"* to print
	a string to standard output or to a file (via a "file-handle").
	array	"MATLAB has no fputs function."
+ *GNU Octave* allows whitespace before the transpose operator, but
	*Matlab* does not.
+ *GNU Octave* does not require the use of ellipses for line continuation
	but *Matlab* does.
	 
	Use a backslash "\" to indicate line continuation.
+ *GNU Octave*'s e operators may be rendered unacceptable by
	*Matlab*.
+ *GNU Octave* have toolboxes for different applications, just like
	*Matlab*'s toolboxes.

	In *GNU Octave*, the "system data structure" (i.e., system model)
		requires the installation of the Octave Controls System Toolbox.
+ Comment, for single lines:
	- *Matlab*: percent sign
	- *GNU Octave*: pound sign, or percent sign
+ Exponentiation:
	- *Matlab*: "^"
	- *GNU Octave*: "^" or "**" 
+ String delimiters:
	- *Matlab*: "'"
	- *GNU Octave*: "'" or """
+ For **ends**:
	- *Matlab*: requires **end**
	- *GNU Octave*: use "end{if,for, ...}"














#	Enabling Seamless Interoperability Between Programming Languages

See [Interoperability Between Programming Languages](interoperability-between-programming-languages.md).

##	Integrating *GNU Octave* Code Into *C++* Code

To integrate *GNU Octave* code into a *C++* codebase, include the header file *"octave/oct.h"*.

That is, use:

	#include \<octave/oct.h\>

See [C++ integration; including *GNU Octave* code into a *C++* codebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave#C.2B.2B_integration) [WikipediaContributors2016].


##	Integrating *C++* Code Into *GNU Octave* Code

To integrate *C++* code into a *GNU Octave* codebase, create
	*oct* files and use them in my codebase.

Alternatively, I can create *Matlab*-compatible *MEX* files
	and use them in my codebase. 

See [C++ integration; including *GNU Octave* code into a *C++* codebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave#C.2B.2B_integration) [WikipediaContributors2016].

###	Creating *oct* Files

Use the *mkoctfile* function to compile the C, C++, or Fortran
	source code into either of the following, based on the options
	used with the *mkoctfile* function 
	[TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustinStaff2016]:
+ Compiled code that can be called within *GNU Octave*
+ Stand-alone *GNU Octave* application

Call the *mkoctfile* function from the shell prompt of the "Terminal"
	application or the *GNU Octave* prompt 
	[TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustinStaff2016]
