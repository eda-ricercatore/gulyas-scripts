#	Notes About *Texinfo*

##	Language Translation with *makeinfo*

###	For the *GNU Octave* Application

The command line option "--texi-macros-file filename" "[specifies] 
	the name of the file containing *Texinfo* macros for use
	by *makeinfo*" \cite[pp. 17, \S2.1.1]{Eaton2016a}. 

By default, *GNU Octave* uses *makeinfo* for language translation to
	generate documentation (in other formats, such as HTML and PDF) via *Texinfo* 
	\cite[pp. 23, \S2.3]{Eaton2016a}. 




##	Getting Help Information

###	For the *GNU Octave* Application

Help information for a command in *GNU Octave* can be obtained in
	different formats, such as: *texinfo*, HTML, or "plain text" 
	\cite[pp. 24-25, \S2.3]{Eaton2016a}.





##	Information Provided By Errors And Warnings

###	For the *GNU Octave* Application


Information, including "help information," provided for errors raised
	by a command in *GNU Octave* can be provided in different
	levels of verbosity \cite[pp. 206-207, \S12.1.1]{Eaton2016a}.


##	Examples

\#\# -*- texinfo -*-

\#\# @deftypefn {Function File} f (@var{arg1})

\#\# Function help text goes here...

\#\# @end deftypefn

###	Commenting Classes in *GNU Octave*

Classes are supported in *GNU Octave*, so that developers can use
	the object-oriented programming paradigm to develop software
	using *GNU Octave*.
A guideline on how to comment classes in *GNU Octave*, using *Texinfo* 
	is shown on pp. 721, in \S34.1 \cite[pp. 721, \S34.1]{Eaton2016a},
	\cite[pp. 733, \S34.4.3]{Eaton2016a}, 
	\cite[pp. 734, \S34.5]{Eaton2016a}, and 
	\cite[pp. 737, \S34.5]{Eaton2016a}.
