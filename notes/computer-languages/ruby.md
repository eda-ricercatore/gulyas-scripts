#	Notes About *Ruby*

## Notes about Programming Paradigms Supported by *Ruby* 

### Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm

Everything in *Ruby* is an object. Each function returns something; if an explicit
	return is not specified, the function will return the value of the last processed
	expression (in the function) \cite[\S2.3, pp. 35]{Tate2010}.

Ruby supports functional programming; it allows functions to be passed to other
	functions as parameters \cite[\S2.3, pp. 36]{Tate2010}.


## *Ruby* Collections

### Arrays, or [Linear] Ordered Collection

When an out-of-bounds array index is accessed, *nil* is returned by *Ruby*
	\cite[\S2.3, pp. 36]{Tate2010}.

*array_name[-n]* returns the *n*^{th} element from the end
	\cite[\S2.3, pp. 36]{Tate2010}.

Arrays are not required to be homogeneous \cite[\S2.3, pp. 37]{Tate2010}.

"Multidimensional arrays are ... arrays of arrays" \cite[\S2.3, pp. 37]{Tate2010}.


## Functional Programming with *Ruby*

### Code Blocks

"A code block is a function without a name"; it can be passed as a parameter
	to a function or a method;
	"code blocks can take one or more parameters"
		\cite[\S2.3, pp. 39]{Tate2010}.



##	Other Programming Concepts in *Ruby*

"Metaprogramming means writing programs that write programs"
	\cite[\S2.4, pp. 48]{Tate2010}.

Open classes in *Ruby* can redefine *String* and *Nil* \cite[\S2.4, pp. 49]{Tate2010}:
	- Also, *Ruby* can be disabled by redefining *Class.new*. 
	- *Ruby* gives us the freedom to redefine classes or objects at any time. 

When "a method is missing", *Ruby* calls "a special debugging method,"
	*method_missing*, "to print some diagnostic information";
	this method *method_missing* can be overridden
		\cite[\S2.4, pp. 49]{Tate2010}.
