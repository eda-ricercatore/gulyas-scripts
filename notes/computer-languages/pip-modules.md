#	List of *PIP*-based *Python* modules


List of *PIP*-based *Python* modules to add to, or install in, my Google Colab
	environment:
+ pip install pycorrelate
+ pip install matplotlib
+ pip install numpy


Since *Google Colab* may not support the *Anaconda* platform for data science
	and scientific computing, use the *PIP* package manager to install *Python*
	packages.
+ To use the *Anaconda* platform on *Google Colab*, try:
	- https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/google-auth (may not be relevant)
	- https://rjai.me/posts/google-colab-conda/ (works for Python 2.7, not
		Python 3.X)
