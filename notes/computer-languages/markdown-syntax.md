#	Notes about the Markdown Syntax

##	Notes About Horizontal Rules/Lines

The following can be used to draw horizontal rules/lines \cite{Gruber2004}:
+ Three consecutive asterisks: *`***`*
+ Three asterisks, with a character space in between them: *`* * *`*
+ Five consecutive asterisks: *`*****`*
+ Three consecutive dashes: *`---`*

Note that these horizontal rules/lines cannot be drawn to partition
	a list.
