#	Operazione Andare a ICCAD

+ Object-oriented programming (OOP)
	- \S11.4 Variable-length argument lists
	- \S11.6-\S11.7 Variable-length return lists
	- \S11.9 Function files
	- \S11.10 Script files
	- \S11.11 Function handles, anonymous functions, and inline functions
	- \S34 Object-oriented programming
+ \S15 Plotting
+ \S14 Input/Output (I/O) operations
	(or I/O operazioni)
+ Texinfo
	- Learn how to write comments in the *Texinfo* typesetting syntax
		for documentation generation.
	- E.g., see [example](https://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/20327447/).
+ Miscellaneous
	- \S17.5 Utility function
	- \S17.6 Special function
+ Generate RTW signals, using PRNG
	- Demonstrate that these signals have zero cross-correlation,
		since there are statistically independent.
		Do this for each pair of signals, H(t) and L(t)
	- Show the time-correlation for time-shifted signals.
+ Fix boilerplate code
	- Add utilities feature to convert real (or floating-point)
		numbers into strings.
		Test this feature.
+ Always practise "Continuous Integration"

#	Side Projects

+ Learn *R*.
+ Learn *Scala*.
+ Transfer objects between programs implemented in the following
	computer languages:
	- *GNU Octave*
	- *R*
	- *Scala*
	- *Python*
	- *C++*
+ Add experimental results and other information into databases,
	using database management systems (DBMS).
	- *SQL* databases; e.g., *MySQL*.
	- [*NoSQL* databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL). Also,
		see [Comparison of structured storage software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_structured_storage_software).
	- [*NewSQL* databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSQL)
	- Avoid using database administrator tools to manage such
		databases.
+ Design EDA benchmarks
	- processors
	- VLSI systems
	- AMS/RF ICs
	- mixed-signal SoC 
	- In HDLs, such as Chisel and SystemC/SystemC-AMS

#	Scripts to Hack

+ Script to check if a list of names is unique
	- Flag similar names, and prompt use to verify their equivalence.
	- E.g., Ann Kripa George, Ann K. George, and Ann George are 
		equivalent.
+ Script to change/remove file extensions.
	- Add (-a)
	- Delete (-d)
	- Modify = delete + add (-m)
