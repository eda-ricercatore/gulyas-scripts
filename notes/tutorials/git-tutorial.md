#	*Git* and *GitHub* Tutorial

A brief introduction to *Git* and *GitHub* can be found in the
	["Hello World" tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
	\cite{GitHubStaff2016b}, from [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
	\cite{GitHubStaff20XY}.

Use *GitHub*, or another Web-based source-code-hosting service, to share your
	portfolio online with other people \cite{Nguyen2014}.
	The portfolio can be used for software development, data science, embedded
		hardware design, VLSI design, UI/UX design, and/or product design.

###	Documenting Projects

The [Documenting your projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) \cite{GitHubStaff2016c} document shows us how we can document our projects for software development, data science, or otherwise, such that other people can quickly and easily find information that they need about your project/repository.

[\cite{Gruber2004}](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a seminal document on *Markdown*, which we can use as a reference for *Markdown*. *Markdown* provides us with a simple way to document projects hosted in *GitHub* repositories, or other Web-based source-code-hosting service.

Quick look-up references/manuals for *Markdown* are:
+ [\cite{Chapellier2018}](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md)
+ [\cite{GitHubStaff2014}](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)



###	Miscellaneous Information

Use the [Making Your Code Citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) \cite{GitHubStaff2016d} document to learn how to assign a digital object identifier (DOI), so that a *GitHub* repository can be cited along with its associated research publications.
