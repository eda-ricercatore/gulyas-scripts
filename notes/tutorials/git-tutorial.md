#	*Git* and *GitHub* Tutorial

A brief introduction to *Git* and *GitHub* can be found in the
	["Hello World" tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
	\cite{GitHubStaff2016b}, from [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
	\cite{GitHubStaff20XY}.

Use *GitHub*, or another Web-based source-code-hosting service, to share your
	portfolio online with other people \cite{Nguyen2014}.
	The portfolio can be for software development, data science, embedded
		hardware design, VLSI design, UI/UX design, and/or product design.

###	Documenting Projects

\cite{Gruber2004} is a seminal document on *Markdown*, which we can use as a reference for *Markdown*. *Markdown* provides us with a simple way to document projects hosted in *GitHub* repositories, or other Web-based source-code-hosting service.

Quick look-up references/manuals for *Markdown* are:
