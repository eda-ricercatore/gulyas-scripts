##	Accuracy and Precision

+ \cite{Carter2005c}:
	- "Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard or known value."
	- "Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other."
	- "Precision is independent of accuracy."
+ \cite{Pierce2019}:
	- "Accuracy is how close a measured value is to the actual (true) value."
	- "Precision is how close the measured values are to each other."
	- "aCcurate is Correct (a bullseye)".
	- "pRecise is Repeating (hitting the same spot, but maybe not the correct spot)".
	- "When we measure something several times and all values are close, they may all be wrong if there is a `Bias'."
	- "Bias is a systematic (built-in) error which makes all measurements wrong by a certain amount."
	- "In each case all measurements are wrong by the same amount. That is bias."
	- "Degree of Accuracy is how precise a measurement is, often shown as the number of decimal places or significant digits."
	- "Accuracy depends on the instrument we are measuring with."
	- "As a general rule," "the degree of accuracy is half a unit each side of the unit of measure."
	- "We should show final values that match the accuracy of our least accurate value used."
	- From "Errors in Measurement: Absolute, Relative and Percentage Error" Web page referred to by \cite{Pierce2019}, \url{https://www.mathsisfun.com/measure/error-measurement.html}:
		* "The Absolute Error is the difference between the actual and measured value." ... Or, the "the size (the absolute value) of the difference."
		* "But ... when measuring we don't know the actual value! So we use the maximum possible error."
		* "The Relative Error is the Absolute Error divided by the actual measurement."
		* "Relative Error =  Absolute Error/Measured Value"
		* "The Percentage Error is the Relative Error shown as a percentage"
			+ "(|Approximate Value âˆ’ Exact Value|/|Exact Value|) * 100%"
+ \cite{WikipediaContributors2019c}:
	- "Precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability."
	- Definition \#1: Accuracy "is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; low accuracy causes a difference between a result and a `true' value. ISO calls this trueness."
	- Definition \#2: "ISO defines accuracy as describing a combination of both types of observational error above (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness."
	- "Given a set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity, the set can be said to be precise if the values are close to each other, while the set can be said to be accurate if their average is close to the true value of the quantity being measured".
	- "The two concepts are independent of each other, so a particular set of data can be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither."
	- "In the fields of science and engineering, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's true value.[1] The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results."
