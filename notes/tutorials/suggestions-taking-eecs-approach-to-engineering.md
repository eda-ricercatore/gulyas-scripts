#	Suggestions for Taking An EECS Approach to Engineering


##	Analogies between Different Dynamical Systems

The book, "Modeling of Dynamic Systems" \cite{Ljung1994}, by Lennart Ljung and Torkel Glad, describes analogies between different dynamical systems \cite{Lobontiu2010,CannonJr2003,Karnopp2012,Esfandiari2018,Ghosh2017,vanAmerongen2010} (or "dynamic systems" in the book "Ljung1994"), such as:
+ mechanical systems.
+ electrical systems, electronic systems
+ fluid systems
+ thermal systems
+ liquid system modeling
+ pneumatic systems
+ electromechanical systems



By recognizing analogies between dynamical systems, you can map electrical circuits into various engineering/dynamical systems (i.e., the analogical models or dynamical analogies) that you are familiar with and analyze them.
+ [Analogical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogical_models)
+ [Mechanicalâ€“electrical analogies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical%E2%80%93electrical_analogies)
+ [System equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_equivalence)

##	Big Data, Data Science, and Internet of Things (IoT)

The era of "Big Data" \cite{Manyika2011a,Agrawal2012,WorldEconomicForumStaff2012,Berman2013,Holdren2014,BilbaoOsorio2014,OHalloran2015,TheEconomistIntelligenceUnitLimitedStaff2015,Moustakerski2015} is here, since we can store information digitally at low costs and data collection can be automated. This drives the growth of the field, "data science" \cite{Cady2017}.

Concurrently, thanks to Moore's law \cite{Thackray2015,Brynjolfsson2014,Fuller2011,Duranton2010,Roy2010,Tehranipoor2008}, cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things (IoT) \cite{Sundmaeker2010,Witchalls2013} devices can be used in many, if not most, industries and market segments.

Consequently, consider learning how to use electronic circuits and systems as well as cyber-physical systems to: acquire, process, and store data; control or manipulate mechatronic systems; and monitor systems, the environment, and living organisms.

The course "ECEN 215 Principles of Electrical Engineering" at Texas A&M University can help you integrate electronic circuits, electronic systems, and cyber-physical systems into your engineering systems/projects.

For example, you can:
+ use sensor systems/networks for [structural health monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring) of buildings and bridges
+ use electronic systems to control mechanical systems (e.g., cars and aircraft); see [mechatronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics)
+ use sensor systems/networks (and [MEMS accelerometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer)) to monitor biomechanics and bioelectrical signals (and other [biosignals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignal))
+ use sensor systems/networks, electronic systems, and machine learning to automate quality control and process control


###	An Aside: Putting Different Topics of EECS in the Context of Soft E-Skin Technologies

"Coupled with advances in the IoT, e-textiles, virtual reality, augmented reality, soft robotics, Industry 4.0, organ on chips, and artificial intelligence/deep learning, the soft e-skin technologies hold the promise of achieving a new level of human connectedness." Read this month's Proceedings of the IEEE Point of View article on e-skin written by Prof. Ravinder Dahiya: http://bit.ly/2RDM910 (or https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2018.2890729).
