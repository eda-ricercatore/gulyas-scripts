##	From Sports

###	From NBA Basketball

"Somewhere there is a little kid working to enhance what we've done. It may take awhile, but someone will come along who approaches the game the way I did. He won't skip steps. He won't be afraid. He will learn from my example, just as I learned from others. He will master the fundamentals. Maybe he will take off from the free-throw line and do a 360 in midair. Why not? No one thought they would see a 6-foot-9 point guard or a 7-foot-7 center. But here we are. There are now more 6-foot-10 perimeter players than at any time in history. Magic would have been a center 30 years ago. Evolution knows no bounds. Unless they change the height of the basket or otherwise alter the dimensions of the game, there will be a player much greater than me."
- Michael Jordan, \cite[Chapter 3, "It was like being a kid again.", pp. 111]{Jordan1998}



###	From Long-Distance Track

"Somewhere a young man is hearing of this (i.e., Haile Gebrselassie's world records) and training for his own future. In Kenya. Or in Ethiopia. Or perhaps even in the United States. The message should be clear: Whatever you are doing, do more. However fast you are running, run faster."
- Tim Layden, \cite{Layden1998}



##	From EECS

"Maybe one of those bright kids will grow up, challenge the established way of doing things, and change the world of technology. Just like Andrew Viterbi."
- Tekla S. Perry, \cite{Perry2010,Perry2010a}
