%\usepackage[margin=1.5cm,vmargin={0pt,1cm},nohead]{geometry}
\usepackage[margin=1.5cm,vmargin={1.5cm,2cm}]{geometry}
% Use the packages needed to typeset algorithms. I can also use the combined ``algorithms'' bundle.
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% The listings package is a source code printer for LaTeX. You can typeset stand alone files as well as listings with an environment similar to verbatim as well as you can print code snippets using a command similar to \verb. Many parameters control the output and if your preferred programming language isnÕt already supported, you can make your own definition.
\usepackage{listings}
% Use the ``clrscode3e'' LaTeX package to typeset algorithms like CLRS
%	\usepackage{/data/others/notes/clrscode3e}
\usepackage{/Users/zhiyang/Documents/rapporti/grappanotes/clrscode3e}
%\usepackage{/data/others/grappanotes/clrscode3e}

\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag}

% Concatenate adjacent references together when typeset.
% That is, cite{ref1,ref2,ref3,ref4} can appear as [12-15], instead of [12] [13] [14] [15]
\usepackage{cite}
% For automatic insertion of cross-referencing words, such as fig. for figures and eq. for equations.
%		\usepackage{cleveref}

% LaTeX support for Metafont and MetaPost logos.

% How to typeset single and double quotes for feet and inches?
% For feet, use [FEET]\textasciiacute
% For inches, use [INCHES]\textacutedbl
% For feet and inches, use [FEET]\textasciiacute\ [INCHES]\textacutedbl; force a character space between the single quote for feet and the height of the object in inches
% Don't use \textceltpal as a single quote to represent height in feet, or double \textceltpal (two concatenated \textceltpal) as a double quote to represent height in inches
% For double quotes, don't use two single quotes provided by the default settings of LaTeX. The resultant double quotes will be curly.

% The tipa package is for Phonetic Symbols -- I wanna use the \textceltpal symbol to represent a single quote, instead of using the generic ``curly'' single quote from \LaTeX (Table 10, pp.10)
\usepackage{tipa}
% The textcomp package is for Diacritics -- I wanna use the \textacutedbl symbol to represent a double quote (Table 28, pp.17), instead of using the generic ``curly'' double quotes from \LaTeX; however, when this symbol is used, I must force a character space to exist after the symbol by using the backslash followed by a character space. This package also provides the symbol for Copyleft, \textcopyleft, which is not available in LaTeX by default, and provides better looking symbols for: copyright, registered, and trademark (Table 33, pp.18). Also, it provides symbols for: \textcelsius, \textmho, \textmu, \textohm (Table 201, pp.67). It also provides symbols for Genealogical Symbols (Table 253, pp78), such as \textborn, \textdivorced, \textmarried, \textdied, and \textleaf (symbol of a leaf)... Its symbol for the Euro, EU currency, is \texteuro
\usepackage{textcomp}
% Look at \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf} for a list of symbols that can be used in LaTeX and its packages. Table 280, pp.88, deals with Symbol Name Clashes; hence, if the same command name refers to multiple symbols, the symbol-conflict resolution abides by this.
% In particular, check out the gensymb package (Table 197, page 67) for symbols defined to work in both math and text modes, such as \celsius, \micro, \degree, and \ohm.
% Also, check out the wasysym package (Table 198, page 67) for electrical symbols, such as that of alternating current (AC); it also provides symbols for \female, and \male (Table 212, pp.70); it also has symbols for ``Xs and Check Marks,'' which are checked boxes, \CheckedBox, squares, \Square, and crossed boxes (boxes filled with a cross), \XBox (Table 232, pp.73); it also has symbols for a clock, \clock, a Simley, \smiley, diameter, \diameter, lightning, \lightning, sun, \sun, and a tick or check mark \checked (symbol to indicate that something is correct), and a bell, \bell (Table 254, pp.78); it also has symbols for left and right turns (Table 256, pp.78), \leftturn and \rightturn; this package (Table 256, pp.78) and the arev package (Table 257, pp.78) can be used to typeset music symbols, along with Table 182, pp.62; it also has symbols for Navigation (Table 261, pp.79), such as \Forward, \RewindToStart, and \ForwardToIndex; it also has symbols for laundry (Table 262, pp.80); it also has the symbol for a heart, \Heart (Table 263, pp.80).
% In addition, check out the ifsym package (Table 199, page 67) for pulse diagram symbols; it also has symbols for weather (Table 266, pp.80), alpine and mountain climbing, such as \Summit, \Mountain, \IceMountain, \VarMountain, \Flag, \FilledHut, \Hut, \Village, and \Tent (Table 267, pp.81); it also has different symbols for clocks, such as \Interval, \StopWatchEnd, \VarClock, \showclock (to indicate the time) (Table 268, pp.81); it also has symbols for fire, letter, telephone, dice, \PaperPortrait, and \PaperLandscape. Also, has symbol for the cross to indicate that something is incorrect
\usepackage{ifsym}
% Besides, check out the keystroke package (Table 208, page 69) for symbols of Computer Keys, such as Alt, Ctrl, Del, Page down, Esc, Enter, Shift, Space Bar, and Up Arrow.
% From the dingbat package (Table 225, page 72), it has symbols for Fists, such as \rightthumbsdown and \rightthumbsup.
%\usepackage{dingbat}
% From the pifont package (Table 234, page 73), it has symbols for Circled Numbers, such as any digit that is circled, where the space in the circle can be shaded black.
% From the dictsym package (Table 277, page 84), it has symbols for dictionaries, and indicates which type of dictionary will define this term - say a medical, technical, mathematical, or judical dictionary
% The simpsons package can be used to indicate characters from {\it The Simpsons} (Table 278, pp.85)
% The symbol for quadruple integrals \iiiint is available as an AMS Variable-sized Math Operator, or I can use this symbol from the packages txfonts, pxfonts, esint, or MnSymbol 










% The marvosym package (Table 210, page 69) is for Communication Symbols, such as \Email, \fax, \FAX (Preferred), \Letter, \Mobilefone, and \Telefon; it also has the symbol for the Cross to represent Christianity, \Cross (Table 263, pp.80); it also has symbols for checked boxes, \Checkedbox, crossed boxes (boxes marked with a cross), \Crossedbox, bicycles, \Bicycle, clocks, \Clocklogo, the industry, \Industry, taking notes manually with pen/pencil and paper, \Writinghand, coffee, \Coffeecup, providing information or important note, \Info (Table 249, pp.76)... In addition, it has the symbols for the Euro (EU currency), \EUR (OK), \EURdig (OK), \EURtm, \EURcr
\usepackage{marvosym}
% From the bbding package (Table 226, page 72), it has symbols for Fists, such as \HandPencilLeft; it also has symbols for the Cross to represent Christianity, such as \Cross and \CrossOpenShadow (Table 228, pp.72); Use of the symbol \Cross has bugs; bugs exist in the package, as it fails to correctly overwrite the \Cross symbol; also has the peace symbol, \Peace. 
%\usepackage{bbding}
% The skak contains a cross, incorrect symbol that I can use to indicate that something is wrong, e.g. \markera or \weakpt
\usepackage{skak}
% Package to enable the use of a strikeout/strikethrough font with LaTeX. To use the strikeout/strikethrough font, use the ``sout'' LaTeX command, or tag,  to ``strike through'' text. E.g., \sout{Bill Clinton} G.W. Bush is the pres.
\usepackage{ulem}
% The eurosym package has the symbols for the Euro (EU currency), \geneuro, \geneuronarrow, \geneurowide, \officialeuro (GOOD)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Other helpful hints:

% To use the italic and bold font concurrently, try this: {\itshape Review the {\bfseries updated} training log}

% To use the symbol for summation, which is the capital-sigma notation, with proper super- and sub- fixes, try: $\displaystyle\sum_{i = -1}^{m} \frac{log_2 n_i}{T_i}$

% Make sure that I include the following so that I can cite references properly: \usepackage{cite}. This allows references to be included as [1-10], rather than [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]

% Colors that appear well in PDF format for LaTeX text include: red, blue, and magenta

% Use \scriptsize, instead of \textsc, \sc, or \schape to use small caps. Currently, I cannot use \textsc, \sc, or \schape to write in small caps on my MacBook Pro laptop.

% The Typewriter font cannot be used concurrently with the bold font. That is, the following cannot be used: {\tt \bf text}, AND \texttt{\textbf{text}}

% Use \LaTeX for LaTeX; B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX to indicate the symbol for BibTeX; \texttrademark for trademarks; \MF for Metafont; and \MP for MetaPost
