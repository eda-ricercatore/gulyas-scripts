+ Walter Isaacson describes Dr. John L. Hennessy as a creative leader, who can combine wisdom with intelligence and critical/analytical reasoning \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy "distill[ed] ten core concepts" "from various leadership styles" that he learned from, and present these "abstract principles[/concepts] ... with insightful stories and memorable anecdotes [to] bring them to life" \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ He has the humility to appreciate the opinions of others \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A healthy ego does not require ignoring second-guessers and have unwavering conviction about everything, most things, or even many things. This can circumvent or mitigate the combination of ego and insecurity by being humble and confident/secure \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Steve Jobs may be brash and aggresssive, but he has the humility and wisdom to "listen intently" to others and process their opinions \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Being humble requires authenticity, and avoid giving "the pretense of humility" \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- However, Benjamin Franklin argues that by wearing a mask of a particular virtue (or leadership skill), "we become the mask that we wear" (quote from Shakespeare's Prince Hal, which is used by Benjamin Franklin) \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Humility provides the foundation for other leadership "principles"/skills, such as empathy, "leadership as service" (think servant leadership), and collaboration \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Being humble helps us to "listen to [others], find common ground," and collaborate \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Collaborative teams have been more productive than singular inventors \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Storytelling is an important leadership skill \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Leadership is about creating a narrative," and storytelling enables a leader to shape the narrative \cite[\S Forward, pp. xii]{Hennessy2018a}.

##	Introduction section

+ "I hoped that I could succeed, if I approached the job with humility about my own skills, a scientist's respect for the facts, and a stellar team." - Dr. John L. Hennessy \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 4]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy classifies aspects of effective leadership into the following categories: fundamental principles of good leadership (e.g., humility, authenticity, service, and empathy), steadfastness to hold on to these principles, a methodology for institutional transformation (by using courage and the aforementioned fundamental principles), and a methodology for transformational change (i.e., taking a great institution to new heights) \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 6]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Build a determined team around a compelling vision of change for an old institution, and take actions to ensure that the transformation has lasting impact \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Leaders of organizations should focus on the well-being of organizations/governments/countries that they serve in, and the well-being of their members/employees/students and customers/clients/citizens \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ There is a knowledge gap regarding how to lead organizations through necessary transformations \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Our world is changing at an ever-increasing pace" - Dr. John L. Hennessy \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Hence, organizations [and individuals] have to renew themselves with respect to changes and megatrends and macro-trends \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Prepare future, emerging, and junior leaders to address "the changing nature of leadership in the twenty-first century" \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 8]{Hennessy2018a}.



##	Chapter 1, Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership

"It is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err."
\- [Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4794-it-is-unwise-to-be-too-sure-of-one-s-own)
+ Confidence arises from humility, rather than from ego \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Avoid wearing a mask of confidence, phony bravado, or misplaced confidence \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- **"Arrogance sees only our strengths, ignores our weaknesses, and overlooks the strengths of others, therefore leaving us vulnerable to catastrophic mistakes. Humility shows us where our weaknesses lie so we can compensate for them. Humility makes us earn our confidence" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.**
+ Provide career-enabling educational opportunities for my descendants \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 10]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "It is likely there are students who know more about almost any subject than you do." \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 10]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Leaders need the expertise and assistance of their team members to succeed; hence, **"start by admitting what [I] don't know, learn what [my] team members know, and humbly asking for their support"** \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 10]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "For my part, as university president, I understood I was merely a tool for these operations, not the engine itself" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 11]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Be humble and honest in admitting my mistakes, and rally the team for the future \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 17]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Develop the practice of an artful, directed humility focused on self-deprivation, just as I would develop practices of courage and decisiveness. It also involves allowing others to announce my accomplishments, "realizing and openly admitting that my understanding may not be [correct/]right", "willingly soliciting [help/]assistance [when I] know [I] need help," "taking opportunities to learn from [my] mistakes," and "stepping up to [challenging] moments" that help me grow. Such humility does not imply "a lack of ambition". Here, ambition refers to community-centric ambition that makes a difference and an impact on the institution and communities that I serve, as opposed to selfish ambition that primarily benefits only me (or my loved ones and myself). Hence, the only possibility to be ambitious and humble is to have selfless ambition that benefits others \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 18]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Select people based on their "ability to grow on the job" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When you work with people who can "grow on the job," attempt to calibrate their ability to "grow on the job" and measure their ability to "grow on the job" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When hiring people or selecting a replacement for someone, use a person's ability to "grow on the job" as the centerpiece of the search/replacement process \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- **If you can access the humility of a person, you can gauge their ability to learn on the job. This is because that person can acknowledge that they have much to learn, that other people are better than them "at certain things," "and that the ideas of many people are almost always better informed than the opinion of one. Consequently, humility can lead to dedication towards "learning how to be better at what [we] do"** \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Endeavor to be a humility-centered leader, and change the leadership role accordingly \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ In start-up environments, little mistakes can prove to be fatal to the the start-ups \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Hence, leaders in start-up environments have to lead by becoming the equals of the start-up employees. These leaders should "[devote/commit/]dedicate [themselves] to helping [their employees] do better" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "Perhaps the most important instances when you need to practice humility are when you have made the wrong decision. Mistakes happen to every leader, and it's better to accept them, to have the courage to admit the mistakes, and to decide how to move on" ... "The process is not necessarily pleasant, but it is a lot easier if you are humble" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 20]{Hennessy2018a}.




##	Chapter 2, Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership


+ "Maintaining one's integrity is often presented as the greatest challenges faced by adults in their professional and private lives" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Become an embodiment of integrity, trustworthiness, and honor \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "When we talk about integrity, when we tell our children, `Don't lie, don't steal, don't cheat, and follow the rules, even when no one is looking,' we are guiding them towards behaviors that tens of millions of people practice every day" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ **"Far more difficult to practice every day, especially as an adult, is authenticity, the practice of speaking honestly and being true not just to ourselves, but to others, to our communities, to the rest of humanity, even when being honest may subject us to criticism or lead to discord"** \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Endeavor to authentically exhibit integrity in my interactions with others \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Authenticity, a nuanced and multidimensional characteristic, is essential to building trust and therefore to successful leadership" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Decide where to stand on issues, and stand firm in my convictions with courage \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Learn how to "improve [myself so that I can] become all that [I] can be", so that I can avoid animalistic tendencies to "win by any means or at all costs" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Beware of buzzword forms of "authentic leadership" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Endeavor to be what [I] desire to" be, so that other people can see that in me (and improves my reputation - and how I appear to them) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Identify good and true characteristics [that I admire], and work to embody them" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Endeavor to practice the following: "identify the virtues you admire, strive to embody them, and be humble about the journey" (since I probably don't embody them on a consistent basis) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Think about the following questions as a leader: "what path [do I want] to follow in my [life/]career, and what position to take on issues that split the community I [am] leading \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ When people try to sway my stance on an issue, articulate the rationale (leading to my decision to take that stance) to myself and others/them \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ It is hard to speak the difficult truth on the side of the minority when there are huge consequences ("sharing unfortunate news or risking rejection, humiliation, [risk of] bodily injury, and large-scale social ostracism") and risky rewards \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23-24]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Even if we're acting for the greater good, sharing a difficult truth can be painful, especially when the truth will hurt people we care about" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 24]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Be brutally honest, like Steve Jobs, even when it hurts my social well-being (in terms of being like) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 24]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "*While giving the people-pleasing answer might feel good in the moment, the consequences will haunt the organization for a long time.*  Better to **follow the path of authenticity**: **understand the overall mission and direction** - put your feet in the right place - **and make the tough calls** - stand firm" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Pick up the responsibility to "deliver bad news", rather than "hiding from [deliver] bad news" or "passing [the] responsibility to others" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Do so promptly, "balance [my] empathy and humane tendencies [with] the requirements of [my] job ([being] authentic and honest)" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Challenges and challenging times provide me with opportunities "to live up to the authentic ideals [that I] have chosen for" myself, "to act as the leader [that I] strive to be," even when doing so makes me uncomfortable or takes me through a painful process \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25-26]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- As I "grow into the leader that [I] aspire to be," I do so "one [painful or] uncomfortable moment at a time" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Ask myself if my constituents perceive me to be consistent, truthful, trustworthy, and authentic \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- This question matters especially if I am asking people to follow me in a particular direction for the greater good (or well-being) of the institution (or the larger community at heart), and the welfare of those people, especially if that direction is not "an ideal fit for their own ambitions and plans" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
		* If the direction is not for the well-being of the community/institution, they will not get behind me \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ **"Leading any complex institution is a marathon, not a sprint. You need to think in the long term"** \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Build trust with your constituents with long-term thinking, so that when I have to make touch decisions, they would not doubt that I would avoid short-term thinking only. Else, my effectiveness as a leader would be undermined \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Organizations, such as universities and corporations, have internal constituents (e.g., employees) and external constituents (shareholders, alumni, donors, students/parents, research funders, board of trustees, and board of directors) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 27]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A united team does not imply that the team would always have an unanimous agreement on everything (or every issue). It implies that the team would "back the leadership 100 percent, even when the circumstances shifted slightly and we adjusted course" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 27]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When the leadership and the important constituents are fully committed at the start, even when individuals have doubts and uncertainties, so that they can act collaboratively, share ideas and vision prior to them being fully shaped \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 27]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Although the board may ask tough questions and challenge the leadership, once a decision is made, the board and leadership team are joined" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 28]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Develop a trust relationship [with constituents] by being available, open to questions, and candid in my responses" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 28]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Demonstrate [to people] that rational decision making [is] my modus operandi" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Let the insights that I share with my constituents "form the basis of a trust relationship going forward" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Be open and trustworthy with my constituents \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Help my "corporation develop trust relationships with [its] customers," and avoid misleading (or deceiving) them "about product capabilities, availability, or reliability". Else, it would "lose customers and damage their reputations, making it harder to recover by replacing the lost customers" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A corporation must "[go] beyond the more minimal standard of honesty demanded by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Do the shareholders believe that the management team is assessing its challenges and opportunities?" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 30]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ To avoid decadence and jaded attitude in tenured faculty, remind them that their reputation would erode if they do not "go the extra mile, push [themselves] harder, take on new challenges, and make the tough decisions" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 31]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Avoid cutting corners, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term well-being of the corporation, "undermining [my] peers," and being ruthless \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 31]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "The constant change of environment and the need to compete for every rung up the latter also reinforces normative behavior" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 31]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Much of your career path is about knowing where you're headed today, but not necessarily knowing the final destination. It's not fixed yet. You're creating that destination - and yourself - as you go. Some core values may be built in you when you're really young, but so much more develops over time, from your own life experiences, watching other people, or reading great biographies. It's always less painful to learn from others when you can" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 32]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Gordon Bell challenged John L. Hennessy to personally commit to technological innovations that he had been part of, and co-found a spin-off (i.e., start-up using technology transferred from his research lab) to commercialize those technologies. Dr. Bell posited that technologies developed during transformative projects should be further developed commercially (by the spin-off) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 33]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "It is not easy to alter one's set course" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 33]{Hennessy2018a}.



##	Chapter 3, Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom

"It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership."
\- [Nelson Mandela](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/382246-it-is-better-to-lead-from-behind-and-to-put)

+ The following aspects of leadership affect how leaders perceive leadership as service \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 35]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- their remuneration package
	- their authority (i.e., the extent of their authority)
	- the priority of their decisions
	- their subordinates should be dedicated to serving their institution (and their leader)
+ It is important for leaders to remember that the leader's role is to serve their subordinates who are doing the heavy lifting, and help them be "as effective and productive as they can be." A perspective on this is to look at a pyramidal organization chart that is inverted \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 35]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ In order to lead an institution/organization well, a leader has to accept and live the servant-leadership role. The leader has to prioritize the well-being of their organization/institution and community over their (potential) personal gains \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 35]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Take up a leadership role to serve the team, rather than beacuse of the title, social status, or accouterments that come with the role \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 36]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- The larger the leadership role is, "the bigger the role of service in that leadership" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 36]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- I cannot achieve organizational/institutional success on my own. I should remember that my success depends on helping other members of the organization/institution succeed \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 36]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "My career largely existed in reflection of theirs" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 36]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- A leader's task is "to lead the [organization/]institution on a journey of success, by serving each of those constituencies in a manner that maximized the likelihood of our collective success" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 37]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When attempting to lead an organization/institution alone, the role of the leader becomes bigger and heavier over time till it is unbearable  \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 37]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- A leader's task is to plan a direction with the support of the organization's/institution's members, and encourage these members to help the organization/institution arrive at its destination together \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 37]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A humility-based perspective of leadership recognizes that members of my community/organization/institution are dependent on me, and I am also dependent on them (including low-wage workers who play an important role in the day-to-day operations of the organization/institution) \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 37]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Balance the needs and desires of different categories of constituents of my community/organization/institution \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 37]{Hennessy2018a}, including their short- and long- term interests \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 38]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Leaders seeking a long-term tenure at their organizations/institutions should align their interests and compensation with the long-term interests of the communities/organizations/institutions and their stakeholders \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 38]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "A long-term focus means... thinking five to ten years out for a corporation and ten to twenty for a university." Short-term interests should not be ignored when "thinking about new directions and developments" to help the organization/institution move in a good trajectory \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 38]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- As "the landscape of challenges and opportunities" change with new discoveries and inventions, keep exploring new opportunities and help the team/organization/institution get ready to pursue emerging "new directions and opportunities" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 39]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Dr. John L. Hennessy thought about the following questions with his long-term focus \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 39]{Hennessy2018a}:
		* "What does Stanford stand for?"
		* "What shall we be in ten years?"
		* "In one hundred years?"
		* "How do we ensure that future generations of our community will have the same opportunities that we have had?"
+ "Long-term [thinking] introduces more uncertainty and can raise doubts about a direction" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 39]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Unfortunately, these doubts can only be avoided by thinking about the short-term incrementally \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 39]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Leaders have to serve other leaders of the organization, and the rest of the organization \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 39]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "One of the realities of leadership is that the higher one climbs in terms of responsibility, the more the world will ask one to serve outside one's core constituencies"... "How do you decide which invitations to accept and which to decline? Regretfully, you must learn to say no to most of these requests. Why? For one, it would be impossible to do them all"... "Ultimately, any external service you render must be tempered by the fact that your first duty is to your organization and its stakeholders" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 40]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "Develop the fortitude to say no" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 56]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ The "three-part filter" for considering invitations to external service is \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 41]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "How important was the service and the institution being served?"
	- "Could I contribute in an impactful way or could others easily provide the service?"
	- "Would the service opportunity contribute to my learning and growth?"
+ Beware of making commitments during lull periods that are harder to remain dedicated/committed to during busy periods (which may affect my personal integrity), when my primary constituents require more commitment from me (in terms of time and otherwise) \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 41]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Avoid responding with "I am too busy this year," which opens the door for other/additional/further requests, such as "`How about next year or the year after?'" This subsequent response "leads to [the] problem" of predicting my availability that far in advance; \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 41]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Avoid over-commitments such that they jeopardize my ability to serve my primary constituents \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 41]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- If I cannot commit to something (as a personal service to the broader world) for more than two months, decline the request/invitation \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 41]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Create core missions for an organization/institution such that pursuing the core mission would lead to the organization/institution "[serving] the broader community" in the form of "external service initiatives" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 41]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Also, the organization/institution can pursue the core missions in ways that lead to "[serving] the broader community"  and "external service initiatives." This can be a service "extension to their product [and service] offerings" "that has social value, rather than a [pure] profit motive" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 42]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Regarding "[serving] the broader community"  and "external service initiatives," they can include community service to help the locals in the region.
	- Non-profit organizations and government agencies tend to receive more requests to help and serve the people (and engage in public service) \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 42]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Resolve to pursue the core missions in ways that would connect the resources of the organization/institution to/with "the needs of the surrounding communities" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 42]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Research universities can transfer their technological innovations to improve "the quality of life and better functioning of society" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 42]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Leland Stanford Sr. "wishes that [Stanford University] promote the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 43]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Public (research) universities should provide public services for the betterment of societies \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 43]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Important questions for leaders "in universities, corporations, non-profit [organizations], [and] government agencies" to think about serving "the less privileged inhabitants of" their communities are \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 43]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "How should leaders think about the role of public service?"
	- "How should leaders choose which initiatives to support?"
+ If a public service initiative of an organization/institution "veers from its core missions," the organization/institution should "seek a viable exit strategy that minimizes the harm to the community being served" \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 45]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ We should use our creativity to create initiatives that extend the core missions of our organizations/institutions and serve our surrounding/neighboring communities \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 46]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Consider how to create service learning initiatives and programs to help my constituents (e.g., students, employees, and team members) "develop a service mind-set," so that they can pursue servant leadership in turn (i.e., become servant leaders) \cite[\S3 Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom, pp. 46]{Hennessy2018a}.

##	Chapter 4, Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution

+ **Decision making, for big decisions or otherwise, should not solely/only involve empirical facts, data, and dispassionate judgment. Instead, decision making and goal setting should include empathy, which provides "a crucial check on actions" that requires "a deep understanding of and concern for the human condition." This allows us to make decisions and engage in actions for "the well-being of all"** \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 52]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Empathy cannot be calculated by an equation or confirmed by a set of facts, and this is frustrating for an engineering like me. By the same token, empathy is not something you can justify simply with appeals to foundational documents, such as a mission statement. Rather, empathy comes from the heart, which is what makes this deeply human emotion both wonderfully meaningful and, if it is misguided or allowed to overwhelm reason, potentially dangerous" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 52]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ By using trial and error, develop the skill to balance empathy and reason. "Choose and shape the opportunities [to act with empathy] that make the most sense for you and your organization" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 52]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Developing an empathetic response from my organization/institution (i.e., empathy-driven institutional response) to a heart-touching story via a series of well-considered steps \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 53]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy and the concerned student used their creativity to develop an empathy-driven institutional response to her problem by creating a loan forgiveness program for professional degree students pursuing socially valuable career paths \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 53-55]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Develop an "emotional triage to help [me] decide where to put [my] energy and resources" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 55]{Hennessy2018a} with this "series of questions" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 56]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "Does your heart lead you to this issue?"
	- "Do you believe in it enough to take action?"
	- "Would addressing the issue at hand fit with your organization's mission?"
	- "If so, does your organization have the resources to help?"
	- "If not, could you address it personally?"
	- "Of the resources either you or your organization has available, how much do you want to dedicate to this cause, knowing that doing so will limit the resources available for other causes?"
	- "Can you design an impactful, sustainable response to this need?"
	- "These questions can lead you to a deeper understanding of your own values, your colleagues' and your organization's reach, and the issues affecting people in your community and beyond."
+ "Integrate [my]/your head and heart" in my community/public service and decision making, by "listening to [my]/your heart while using [my]/your head, plotting [my]/your direction with a combination of the two" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 56]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ For each organization/"institution that practices philanthropy," not just philanthropic organizations but also corporations/companies and universities, it has to deal with the problem of "mission creep" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 56]{Hennessy2018a}. This happens when the organization/institution starts to "[make] donations to whoever[/whatever] [that] has the most sympathetic story," instead of adhering to well-defined "guidelines about what they plan to give and to whom" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 57]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ The admissions committee at Stanford balances empathy with socioeconomic equity in providing financial aid to admitted students. Hence, Stanford practices needs-blind admissions \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 57]{Hennessy2018a}. Stanford also addressed the "undermatching" problem (see research from Caroline Hoxby and others about sticker shock and inadequate college advising) by offering free tuition or free tuition plus free room and board. They showed compassion/empathy with fairness \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 57-58]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "When empathy contravenes fairness" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 58]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Act upon [empathy] with fairness and reason" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 58]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Express the qualities of "empathy and fairness" "in all areas of your leadership." Prioritize the health and family of my team members before their work, and have the team pick up the slack \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 59]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Taking compensation for a job that one is not fulfilling is not fair to the university. Leaving others on the team to take up the slack isn't fair either. Nor is it healthy for team morale when one person doesn't contribute equally" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 59]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Don't wait too long to tell the offending person that they are slacking, "especially when some aspects of their work are exceptional" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 59]{Hennessy2018a}. "In the name of fairness, though, it's necessary. Still, I tried to communicate the difficult message clearly and with empathy" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 59-60]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "If an employee acts out egregiously, intentionally bringing harm to others or to the institution, in my mind that employee has already fired him or herself" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 60]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Software is much more scalable than large-scale industrialization" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 60]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Think about the societal impact of machine learning and AI-systems on unemployment and underemployment \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 60]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "We may see more and more people experiencing long-term unemployment or underemployment. We need to start thinking about those people now - not least because many may be our neighbors or co-workers. We need to realize that a shifting job market driven by radical technological innovation may lead to temporary unemployment, but it does not mean that the affected individual is unemployable" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 60]{Hennessy2018a}. "We have to think about jobs that didn't even exist before, as well as those that cannot be replaced by computers, no matter how smart" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 60-61]{Hennessy2018a}. "We need more teachers, and we need more people working with the elderly as our society ages -  in other words, jobs in which the human element is deeply embedded and not reducible to algorithms" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 61]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "As leaders and educators, we need to start right now preparing people for that work, and that education must include teaching empathy. It's that human element, the emotional connection and caring, that a human can bring and a robot or an app cannot" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 61]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Empathy usually implies compassion and perhaps charity, but we are looking for more than that: we are looking for the kind of empathy that changes people as a result of their interactions with each other, the kind of empathy that arises when one sees the world anew through someone else's eyes" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 62]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ The Knight-Hennessy Scholar program seeks candidates with empathy, and it would also seek to strengthen the empathy of successful candidates "during their time" Stanford \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 62]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Seek to strengthen other people's resolve to help \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 62]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Stretch beyond understanding that suffering and actually feel it," and "make consequential change and alleviate human suffering" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 62]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Open your heart to people from "economically challenged neighborhood[s] or homeless shelter[s]," and "allow yourself to be changed by the experience." "Let [such] deep empathy guide [me]," and commit/dedicate myself "to creating positive change in the world" \cite[\S4 Empathy: How It Shapes a Leader and an Institution, pp. 63]{Hennessy2018a}.









##	Chapter 5, Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community

+ "Humility, authenticity, empathy, service-mindedness - these characteristics shape a leader's vision and chart a course toward right action. Courage, on the other hand, compels a leader to take that right action. While many people can discern what is right and true, acting on that discernment is more difficult. The leaders who practice courageous action are ready to transform their organizations in necessary, significant, and lasting ways" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 65]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "People often conflate courage with bravery. Certainly they are connected: acts of bravery usually require an underlying courage, and a courageous life is sometimes made manifest through acts of bravery" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 65]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ **"To my mind, courage is continuous, a character trait that serves as a foundation to a life of decisiveness and moral direction. Bravery, however, is incident-based, a willingness to take enormous risks during those brief moments when they need to be taken"** \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 65]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "A soldier storming a pillbox on Omaha Beach on D-Day is incredibly brave; that same soldier, now permanently injured, requires courage to get through the subsequent years of pain, disability, and reinventing his life" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 65]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "**In large and small ways, the courage in our character is tested regularly.** As a leader, you may need to draw on personal courage to respond to events outside your organization, such as a natural disaster or a national tragedy. You also may need to call on your courage to address internal events, to take necessary risks, to change your position, to admit a mistake, or to recover from a failure" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "To different degrees, each of us has that courage in our character. How much we're willing to exercise it, I believe, is a product of how many times we've flexed and strengthened that muscle in the past. Courageous people are no less fearful than everyone else; rather they've learned to live with their fears while taking right action... The learning curve is long and punctuated with moments of terror. Yet acting with courage gets easier with each lesson" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Demands for courage from a leader are often greater than from the people they lead" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Leaders ... enjoy certain advantages that help them bolster their courage" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Four pillars [that help to] bolster" Dr. John L. Hennessy's courage \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66-82]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "Remember the core mission" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66]{Hennessy2018a}
	- "Step up when the community needs you" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 69]{Hennessy2018a}
	- "Sometimes courage means standing firm" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 73]{Hennessy2018a}
	- "Don't be afraid to take risks" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 76]{Hennessy2018a}
+ "When facing a real challenge in a leadership role, people have a tendency to personalize that challenge, to make solving it their own private quest. From my experience, you will solve few such challenges that way. Rather, you are more likely to become overwhelmed, to let your emotions and passions get in the way, and to lose perspective and objectivity" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "In difficult times, I found it helpful to remember that the challenges were not about me as a person, but about my role as the leader of my organization" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 66]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "From the looks of it, most leaders feel comfortable in front of a crowd. They seem always to know what to say and how to say it. Behind the scenes, though, they have to tap into their courage to rise to the occasion. They have to work hard to make it look easy. How do they do it? When leaders focus on speaking not as themselves but as a voice for their organization, they become the embodiment of the institution, and thus they speak with a power and confidence they would never have speaking just for themselves. Remember, your institution has enough confidence in you to have made you its leader, so no matter how personally frightened or nervous you may be, you can speak from that confidence and from that duty" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 69]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ From the end of [Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_second_inaugural_address):
	- "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."
	- \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 71]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "In the second inaugural, [Abraham Lincoln] reminds us that the right and courageous action is not seeking revenge, but acting with compassion and working for peace" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 71]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Explore the relationships between intrinsic differences and societal effects" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 71]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy sought to learn about the impact of implicit and explicit bias on "girls and women ... pursuing careers in science and" engineering \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 71-72]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Backlash against attempts to improve social equity, including gender equity and ethnic/racial equity \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 72]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Increasing the representation of women in these fields [or, science and engineering] was both fair and important to the country" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 72]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ The "Google memo" also used biology to justify differences in abilities between genders \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 72]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Speak[ing] out to carry the voice of your institution" "does not mean [that] your rhetoric will carry the day" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 72]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Courage means being willing to try - and to continue trying - even if you may not succeed. Creating lasting social change requires persistent action, across generations. Even if you don't realize the end result you seek in your lifetime, you can find courage in the fact that you are changing people's lives for the better along the way" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 72]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Suggestions for public speaking \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 72-73]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "Prepare your message"
	- "Edit [your message] ruthlessly (make it shorter, more precise, clearer)"
	- "Practice [your message] endlessly (assuming you have time, crises have their own clocks)"
+ "If you focus on the needs of your audience first, you can trust that you will stay on course and your courage will find you" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 73]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Find the courage to stand firm" against speaking out for an "advocated speech or action [that] would violate a core principle of the institution, would be unfair to individuals, or would have negative consequences for the institution" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 73]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Find a way to listen to demands [from (student) protesters and advocacy groups], to discern the right action, and to stand firm with our decisions" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 74]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Beware [of] unintended consequences" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 74]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "New challenges are constantly emerging, and what might be considered success is forever evolving" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 76]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "**In the fast-moving twenty-first century, the overly cautious are soon rolled over by the speeding wheels of change**" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 76]{Hennessy2018a}. "Effective modern leadership is driven by the ability to manage and grow an organization in an environment of continuous change" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 76-77]{Hennessy2018a}. "This means not only activating the courage to take well-calculated risks, but also learning to navigate the cycle that follows risk, quickly decisively recovering if a risk fails, or capitalizing on its successes. Further, even if risk-taking is against your nature, for the good of the organization, you must find the courage to practice it. As the leader, you set the behavior pattern for everyone you lead. A risk-adverse leader's behavior can undercut innovation and the sharing of new ideas throughout an organization" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 77]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Being a risk-taker has its own challenges" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 77]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "A chief executive can encounter resistance from institutional stakeholders who don't want to see change, either because they are doing well with the status quo (often managers and supervisors), because they are afraid of losing what they've got (often investors and lower-level employees), or because they have a thoughtful disagreement with the new direction. This last group should never be ignored, because they may be - at least partially - right" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 77]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "It is your job as a leader to decide whether or not to take a risk. You may improve your chances of success by doing your due diligence, and you may minimize the likely backlash by educating your stakeholders on the benefits of your strategy, but in the end the decision is yours" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 77]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "If you realize you have steered your organization in the wrong direction, you need to find the courage to admit that fact and change course, ideally minimizing your losses. The deeper you are into the process, the more courage it takes to reverse yourself" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 77]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "You may suspect I'm speaking from experience here. I am" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 77]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "showing the courage to pursue it" and "the courage to walk away from it" (when negotiations fell apart, since the deal would violate the fundamental principles and core values of Stanford) \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 81]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "The Stanford community supports mindful risk-taking and respects bold, value-driven action" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 81]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Though you may need to let go of a dream, when you lead with courage, your effort will not be lost, and you may be pleasantly surprised by what you gain" \cite[\S5 Courage: Standing Up for the Institution and the Community, pp. 81]{Hennessy2018a}.


##	Chapter 6, Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone

"Coming together is a beginning; [keeping/]staying together is progress; working together is success."
\- [Edward Everett Hale](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/edward_everett_hale_121997):

	- *This quote (attributed to Henry Ford) is disputed or misattributed. It should be attributed to Edward Everett Hale, or both Edward Everett Hale and Henry Ford.*


Notes from this chapter:
+ "Leadership is... all about collaboration and teamwork" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 83]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "[Team leaders,] your team members are your equals, and in terms of contribution, some will be your superiors" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 83]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Avoid being a petty, tyrannic team leader that demands their "contribution... be recognized before and above everyone else's" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 83]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "The classic model, *[primus inter pares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus_inter_pares)*, or first among equals, has produced the best results" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 83]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "An effective leader needs to know not only how to participate on a team, but also how to build a team, how to motivate its members, and how to foster an environment that supports creative thinking, in which  team members can make the kind of nonlinear, non-incremental contributions that lead to great outcomes" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 84]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Science and engineering/technology can play a part/role in transforming individuals into "dedicated collaborators" and value/recognize/appreciate synergistic collaboration \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 84]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "Living and working in Silicon Valley and at Stanford have reinforced that belief every single day" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 84]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Recognize that junior members can make insightful contributions because of their "youthful energy, greater willingness to take risks, recent exposure to the latest innovations, an anti-authoritarian attitude, less fear of losing one's reputation, and freedom from precedent" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 84]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "High-tech companies and academia" recognize this, and try "to break down boundaries, both within and across teams" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 84]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "`Flattening' of authority" and "dismantling hierarchical thinking" happen more frequently in science and engineering, since young scientists and engineers are more likely to better research productivity \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 84-85]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "Science and engineering are quantitive [and empirical field]: we can objectively measure and assess the strength of an idea." Since "records of experiments" tend to be meticulously kept, they serve as evidence to settle disputes about the experimental results and attributing/giving/claiming/getting credit \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 85]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ The leader should be a true team player by "encourag[ing] equitable opportunities [for all] to contribute," and set the tone for the corporate culture (or organization's culture). This indicates that the leader "honestly value[s] the contributions of others, [and] set the course for success" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 85]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Develop and use EDA/CAD tools to give small research teams (in computer architecture, VLSI design, compiler design, and operating systems) leverage to design state-of-the-art processors \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 86]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Include "independent, critical thinkers" in the research (or advanced R&D) team who are "willing to revisit and reinvent the conventional wisdom" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 86]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Brainstorming should entail a brief literature review (to "read the relevant literature"), and "offer[ing] ideas for consideration". Constraints and boundaries for brainstorming shall be imposed by "old-timers" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 86]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Use Jeff Bezos's two-pizza rule to create "small, highly effective teams", or "tight group[s] of top-notch thinkers," which can be more efficient than larger teams \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 86]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Jeff Bezos's two-pizza rule is to organize team meetings for small team sizes, such that two pizzas can feed everyone on the team \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 86]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ **"Research has shown that the most productive teams contain the maximum diversity of skills, viewpoints, and personalities"** \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 86]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- **"How do you maximize team heterogeneity, while at the same time holding the team together? This is the ultimate challenge to the leader of any such team"** \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 86]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ For multidisciplinary teams (which can offer multiple/different perspectives), "equally empower each member of your teams" to avoid breaking up/down the team into cliques based on their niche. This is because each research community has its own parlance (or, nomenclature, terminology, or "technical vocabulary"). In addition, a hierarchy of sub- teams/groups may result if at least one sub- team/group perceives itself to be superior, more valuable, or more important than other sub- teams/groups \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 87]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Ground rules for mitigating/circumventing intrateam rivalries \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 87]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- Create a shared goal about "achiev[ing] something great," such that each part of the outcome/thing "[has] to be excellent".
		* This rule "establishe[s]... basic respect for the expertise of all" team members.
	- "At the start, ... don't criticize ideas".
		* This "support[s] innovative, cross-disciplinary thinking" by team members to "think them through and evaluate them without judgment on the source or prejudgment of the idea."
	- "Encourage tough questions" that should be "asked with respect and received with openness", prior to evaluating the ideas/suggestions.
		* This encourage team members to vigorously, or even ruthlessly, challenge the ideas, rather than the team members.
	- "*Team members must be treated with the utmost mutual respect.* After all, if we weren't good enough to be part of the team, we wouldn't have been invited into it. Especially in a group made up of alpha-status individuals, team leaders must quash the notion that the person who speaks the loudest wins. Instead, you must cultivate a work environment that encourages thoughtful debate while discouraging personal criticism or anger."
		* Senior team members should "model and enforce this behavior."
+ Important practices for leaders \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 88]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "Use the [aforementioned] ground rules for teamwork" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 87]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "Encourage new ideas and tough questions."
	- Don't "[shoot people] down for bringing to the table a problem that needed attention." Instead, excoriate team members "for not bringing problem[s] to the table".
		- Create a safe space for team members to bring up problems, so that they won't be "afraid to speak up."
+ "Knowing your role: The key to successful collaboration" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 88]{Hennessy2018a}
+ For "effective collaboration, you must find your part and play it" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 88]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Learn to be "diplomatic, measured, and... patient" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 88]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Learn to be a deep thinker \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 88]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Find a public visionary for the team \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 88]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ If possible, create teams such that for certain roles, various team members can interchangeably fulfill those roles \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 89]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Encourage team members to share information that the team needs to know \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 89]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ **"Collaboration is much more than a few personalities teaming up and working together, hoping the chemistry will balance out. It is rather like a marriage - you make compromises and adjustments toward the overall goal; you face doubts and resolve them together"** \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 92]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "By thinking outside the normal structure of relationships, by building truly collaborative teams, and by aligning our interests, we were able to achieve remarkable things" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 92]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Collaborating up the chain \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 92]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Reflecting on how my superiors encouraged and challenged me to stretch for my goals, I learned how to be a more effective mentor myself" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 92]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy draws an analogy between the CEO and board of directors of a corporation with the president (or equivalent) and board of trustees (who are volunteers) of a university \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 93]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ The board (of directors/trustees) shall provide "fiduciary oversight" for the organization (or, corporation or university), and "step in when the actions of the leader are not serving the [organization] well." It shall be willing to develop a "collaborative relationship" with the CEO (or president of the university). "The board [shall support] the CEO," "[act] as advisors," and "[use] their knowledge and skills to enhance the work of the management team" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 93]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A CEO shall pursue a "collaborative relationship" with the board. The CEO should keep the board of directors of the corporation informed of major issues and challenges concerning the corporation/organization, so that the board would not be surprised when they learn/hear about these from others. In addition, the CEO shall "engage the board in discussions about major decisions and strategic directions, [and gain] wisdom from the board's perspective." A president of a university shall do likewise for the university's board of trustees \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 93]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ The important principles for a successful collaborative relationship (or collaboration) between the CEO (or president of the university) and the board are \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 93]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "[Know and respect] our roles"
		* E.g., the board shall not do the job of the leadership, and "manage or run the university."
		* "Another major role [of the board is that] it is a source of both philanthropy and fundraising, giving and soliciting the gifts that enable the university to thrive" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 93]{Hennessy2018a}.
		* E.g., the leadership 's job is "to manage or run the university"... "the leadership [shall recognize] that the board [has] ultimate responsibility for appointing and evaluating the CEO/president, for protecting the reputation of the university (a shared responsibility), and for ensuring the institution's long-term financial health." In addition, the leadership shall recognize that "the trustees are the guardians of the interests of future generations"... The leadership shall also be "honest and forthright with the board," "[engage] the board on virtually every major decision," and "[trust] that [the board] would listen to and support the decisions of the leadership team."
		* "Understanding these roles allowed us to build a trust relationship."
	- Have "mutual trust" for each other.
+ "The team leader: Choose well and then be ready to help out" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 94]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A leader shall "[participate] in the teams s/he (or, (s)he, he/she) create," and "[delegate] team leadership to others" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 94]{Hennessy2018a}.
 	- "How do you choose the right person?"
	- "Who can you trust to recruit a talented team with the right interpersonal chemistry, to establish a respectful and productive team culture, and to draw the best performance out of each individual member so they reach their collective goals?"
	- How do you help the leader succeed?
	- Initially, "this transition can feel vulnerable."
	- Remember that you got to where you are because you are a good team leader and a member. "Now[,] you must entrust that job to someone else."
	- "How do you know that person will carry the mantle well?"
	- Don't expect or demand my teammates to exhibit the skills and drive that are at least as good as my skills and drive when I was a team member without a leadership role.
	- When I have to delegate team leadership to someone else, beware of "recruiting a team leader" by comparing that person's potential to perform with my performance as a team leader. Else, my self-bias (or self-serving bias) against my weaknesses, failures, errors, and mistakes makes it hard to equitably (or fairly) compare the leadership candidate with my current/past performance as a team leader. I may not have consciously chosen to remember my slow learning pace when learning technologies with steep learning curves, weaknesses, failures, errors, and mistakes.
	- Avoid looking for a leader who would do things exactly the way I would. Instead, look for people with "a history of positive collaboration and... [exhibit] the leadership characteristics" required to get tasks/jobs done.
	- After choosing the team leader, allow the new leader to perform without my oversight and without my micromanagement.
	- Be aware of the risk of (harshly) judging the actions of the new leader, so avoid condemning the perceived "subpar performance" of the new leader \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 94-95]{Hennessy2018a}. Hence, avoid trying to intervene in the leadership and management of them team by helping (or offering to help) the new leader. The only exception is when the team is highly dysfunctional to me and/or others in my social network. Remember that leaders can become better after making mistakes, learning from the mistakes, and avoiding similar mistakes in the future \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 95]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "Trust your team leader, and trust your own judgment. In your role as executive, you don't have the bandwidth to micromanage your appointed leaders. That said, if you see - or if others call your attention to - a project sliding off course, you will need to intervene" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 95]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When intervening in the challenges of a dysfunctional team, coach the struggling leader. Ask questions to "illuminate key issues [for] the team leader... to consider" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 95]{Hennessy2018a}:
		* "Is the team converging?"
		* "Have they identified clear opportunities and challenges?"
		* "Do they have a plan for engaging wider support?"
			+ The leader and the team core may "[have] a clear vision," but they may not "[have] engaged [with] the broader community" for the necessary support.
	- "If you have picked the right person and you ask the right questions, your team leader will get the message and address the issue" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 95]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- If your coaching does improve the leadership challenge, "assess the options[, impact, and cost of] replacing your team leader" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 95]{Hennessy2018a}.
		* Can you fill in as an "interim team leader [(i.e., Do you have the time to do so? Can you provide the required effort for this task?)], while also recruiting and onboarding a replacement?" Else, replacing the team leader may lead to a worse outcome than "maintaining the status quo" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 95]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Can "the [team] leader... attract or inspire team members"? \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 96]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "When you have no one better to take over leadership, you need to make the hard decision: cut your losses and move on. In such cases, I have tried to end the effort gracefully, declaring a partial victory, letting the team claim some success, while diverting resources to more worthy projects with stronger teams" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 96]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Handling a collaborative effort that doesn't work out" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 96]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Factors affecting the success of team collaborations \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 96]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "The choice of the team leader"
	- The support that the organization/institution provides to "visionaries behind [an] initiative"
	- Is the "rationale for [an] initiative" "as compelling as [the visionaries] thought it was"?
	- Did we select sufficiently good "task force members" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 97]{Hennessy2018a}?
	- Did we fail to establish a proper framework for the initiative \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 97]{Hennessy2018a}?
	- Did we fail to delegate tasks appropriately and set the task force to work \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 97]{Hennessy2018a}?
+ When "the opposition [is] entrenched," do you "[steamroll] the opposition" and strain/damage the "trust relationship" with the board of trustees/directors, "[undermine your] ability to pilot future initiatives that required support from the faculty," and adversely affect the well-being of the institution \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 97]{Hennessy2018a}?
+ If you cannot find or create a "graceful exit," "find the courage to admit your mistakes and move on to other opportunities" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 97]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Celebrating shared success" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 98]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "When collaboration works well, when a team reaches or even exceed its goals, often team members don't want to see it end. In fact, the way you end is almost as important as how you begin" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 98]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ To create "a successful team," try to do the following \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 98]{Hennessy2018a}:
	- "Convene a group whose members have found a way to work well with each other despite their differences"
	- "Convene a group whose members" "have set out in pursuit of a goal and achieved it, and who have made an important contribution to the larger enterprise"
	- Teams like these are highly valuable, and you should endeavor to preserve the team and help the team grow as well as you can help them. This enables you to work with your "team members again," and allow them to bring their highly valuable skills and experiences "to other teams."
	- Help the more capable/successful team members pursue leadership roles on teams of their own.
+ "In a face-pace work environment, the tendency is to shut down successful teams abruptly with a simple thank you for their work, or worse, to let a team deflate on its own, with its members dribbling off alone or in small groups. Rather, as one of the great lessons of human culture suggests, successful team efforts should end in celebration and ceremony - a gathering in which each member is recognized for his or her contribution, and the accomplishments of the entire group for his and her contribution, and the accomplishments of the entire group are placed in context and honored" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 98]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "It is easy to dismiss such celebrations as mere retirement parties, but they are meaningful opportunities. As you are the person overseeing the team, your orchestration of this event is one of the most important contributions you can make in a team's story. You are telling all of them, from the leader down to the most junior member, that they are important, and that what they accomplished was valuable" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 98]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Thank each person individually for something particular they had done to support our success. I wanted everyone to know how their specific actions had made the institution better. I wanted them to hear that their efforts mattered and I appreciated them, deeply" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 99]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Collaboration is about" "genuine gratitude and shared goodwill elevated all our spirits" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 99]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Becoming more as a team than you ever could be alone? Why wait until those important people - your teammates - have moved on before you notice who they were to you? Why not celebrate your time together while you are still a team?" \cite[\S6 Collaboration and Teamwork: You Cannot Do It Alone, pp. 99]{Hennessy2018a}.
