+ Walter Isaacson describes Dr. John L. Hennessy as a creative leader, who can combine wisdom with intelligence and critical/analytical reasoning \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy "distill[ed] ten core concepts" "from various leadership styles" that he learned from, and present these "abstract principles[/concepts] ... with insightful stories and memorable anecdotes [to] bring them to life" \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ He has the humility to appreciate the opinions of others \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A healthy ego does not require ignoring second-guessers and have unwavering conviction about everything, most things, or even many things. This can circumvent or mitigate the combination of ego and insecurity by being humble and confident/secure \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Steve Jobs may be brash and aggresssive, but he has the humility and wisdom to "listen intently" to others and process their opinions \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Being humble requires authenticity, and avoid giving "the pretense of humility" \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- However, Benjamin Franklin argues that by wearing a mask of a particular virtue (or leadership skill), "we become the mask that we wear" (quote from Shakespeare's Prince Hal, which is used by Benjamin Franklin) \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
- Humility provides the foundation for other leadership "principles"/skills, such as empathy and "leadership as service" (think servant leadership) \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
