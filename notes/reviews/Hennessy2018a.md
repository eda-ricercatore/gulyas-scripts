+ Walter Isaacson describes Dr. John L. Hennessy as a creative leader, who can combine wisdom with intelligence and critical/analytical reasoning \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy "distill[ed] ten core concepts" "from various leadership styles" that he learned from, and present these "abstract principles[/concepts] ... with insightful stories and memorable anecdotes [to] bring them to life" \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ He has the humility to appreciate the opinions of others \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A healthy ego does not require ignoring second-guessers and have unwavering conviction about everything, most things, or even many things. This can circumvent or mitigate the combination of ego and insecurity by being humble and confident/secure \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Steve Jobs may be brash and aggresssive, but he has the humility and wisdom to "listen intently" to others and process their opinions \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Being humble requires authenticity, and avoid giving "the pretense of humility" \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- However, Benjamin Franklin argues that by wearing a mask of a particular virtue (or leadership skill), "we become the mask that we wear" (quote from Shakespeare's Prince Hal, which is used by Benjamin Franklin) \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Humility provides the foundation for other leadership "principles"/skills, such as empathy, "leadership as service" (think servant leadership), and collaboration \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Being humble helps us to "listen to [others], find common ground," and collaborate \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Collaborative teams have been more productive than singular inventors \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Storytelling is an important leadership skill \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Leadership is about creating a narrative," and storytelling enables a leader to shape the narrative \cite[\S Forward, pp. xii]{Hennessy2018a}.

##	Introduction section

+ "I hoped that I could succeed, if I approached the job with humility about my own skills, a scientist's respect for the facts, and a stellar team." - Dr. John L. Hennessy \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 4]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy classifies aspects of effective leadership into the following categories: fundamental principles of good leadership (e.g., humility, authenticity, service, and empathy), steadfastness to hold on to these principles, a methodology for institutional transformation (by using courage and the aforementioned fundamental principles), and a methodology for transformational change (i.e., taking a great institution to new heights) \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 6]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Build a determined team around a compelling vision of change for an old institution, and take actions to ensure that the transformation has lasting impact \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Leaders of organizations should focus on the well-being of organizations/governments/countries that they serve in, and the well-being of their members/employees/students and customers/clients/citizens \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ There is a knowledge gap regarding how to lead organizations through necessary transformations \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Our world is changing at an ever-increasing pace" - Dr. John L. Hennessy \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Hence, organizations [and individuals] have to renew themselves with respect to changes and megatrends and macro-trends \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Prepare future, emerging, and junior leaders to address "the changing nature of leadership in the twenty-first century" \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 8]{Hennessy2018a}.



##	Chapter 1, Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership

"It is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err."
\- [Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4794-it-is-unwise-to-be-too-sure-of-one-s-own)
+ Confidence arises from humility, rather than from ego \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Avoid wearing a mask of confidence, phony bravado, or misplaced confidence \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- **"Arrogance sees only our strengths, ignores our weaknesses, and overlooks the strengths of others, therefore leaving us vulnerable to catastrophic mistakes. Humility shows us where our weaknesses lie so we can compensate for them. Humility makes us earn our confidence" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.**
+ Provide career-enabling educational opportunities for my descendants \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 10]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "It is likely there are students who know more about almost any subject than you do." \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 10]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Leaders need the expertise and assistance of their team members to succeed; hence, **"start by admitting what [I] don't know, learn what [my] team members know, and humbly asking for their support"** \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 10]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "For my part, as university president, I understood I was merely a tool for these operations, not the engine itself" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 11]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Be humble and honest in admitting my mistakes, and rally the team for the future \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 17]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Develop the practice of an artful, directed humility focused on self-deprivation, just as I would develop practices of courage and decisiveness. It also involves allowing others to announce my accomplishments, "realizing and openly admitting that my understanding may not be [correct/]right", "willingly soliciting [help/]assistance [when I] know [I] need help," "taking opportunities to learn from [my] mistakes," and "stepping up to [challenging] moments" that help me grow. Such humility does not imply "a lack of ambition". Here, ambition refers to community-centric ambition that makes a difference and an impact on the institution and communities that I serve, as opposed to selfish ambition that primarily benefits only me (or my loved ones and myself). Hence, the only possibility to be ambitious and humble is to have selfless ambition that benefits others \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 18]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Select people based on their "ability to grow on the job" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When you work with people who can "grow on the job," attempt to calibrate their ability to "grow on the job" and measure their ability to "grow on the job" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When hiring people or selecting a replacement for someone, use a person's ability to "grow on the job" as the centerpiece of the search/replacement process \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- **If you can access the humility of a person, you can gauge their ability to learn on the job. This is because that person can acknowledge that they have much to learn, that other people are better than them "at certain things," "and that the ideas of many people are almost always better informed than the opinion of one. Consequently, humility can lead to dedication towards "learning how to be better at what [we] do"** \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Endeavor to be a humility-centered leader, and change the leadership role accordingly \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ In start-up environments, little mistakes can prove to be fatal to the the start-ups \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Hence, leaders in start-up environments have to lead by becoming the equals of the start-up employees. These leaders should "[devote/commit/]dedicate [themselves] to helping [their employees] do better" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 19]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "Perhaps the most important instances when you need to practice humility are when you have made the wrong decision. Mistakes happen to every leader, and it's better to accept them, to have the courage to admit the mistakes, and to decide how to move on" ... "The process is not necessarily pleasant, but it is a lot easier if you are humble" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 20]{Hennessy2018a}.




##	Chapter 2, Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership


+ "Maintaining one's integrity is often presented as the greatest challenges faced by adults in their professional and private lives" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Become an embodiment of integrity, trustworthiness, and honor \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "When we talk about integrity, when we tell our children, `Don't lie, don't steal, don't cheat, and follow the rules, even when no one is looking,' we are guiding them towards behaviors that tens of millions of people practice every day" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ **"Far more difficult to practice every day, especially as an adult, is authenticity, the practice of speaking honestly and being true not just to ourselves, but to others, to our communities, to the rest of humanity, even when being honest may subject us to criticism or lead to discord"** \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 21]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Endeavor to authentically exhibit integrity in my interactions with others \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Authenticity, a nuanced and multidimensional characteristic, is essential to building trust and therefore to successful leadership" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Decide where to stand on issues, and stand firm in my convictions with courage \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Learn how to "improve [myself so that I can] become all that [I] can be", so that I can avoid animalistic tendencies to "win by any means or at all costs" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Beware of buzzword forms of "authentic leadership" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 22]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Endeavor to be what [I] desire to" be, so that other people can see that in me (and improves my reputation - and how I appear to them) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Identify good and true characteristics [that I admire], and work to embody them" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Endeavor to practice the following: "identify the virtues you admire, strive to embody them, and be humble about the journey" (since I probably don't embody them on a consistent basis) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Think about the following questions as a leader: "what path [do I want] to follow in my [life/]career, and what position to take on issues that split the community I [am] leading \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ When people try to sway my stance on an issue, articulate the rationale (leading to my decision to take that stance) to myself and others/them \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ It is hard to speak the difficult truth on the side of the minority when there are huge consequences ("sharing unfortunate news or risking rejection, humiliation, [risk of] bodily injury, and large-scale social ostracism") and risky rewards \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 23-24]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Even if we're acting for the greater good, sharing a difficult truth can be painful, especially when the truth will hurt people we care about" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 24]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Be brutally honest, like Steve Jobs, even when it hurts my social well-being (in terms of being like) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 24]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "*While giving the people-pleasing answer might feel good in the moment, the consequences will haunt the organization for a long time.*  Better to **follow the path of authenticity**: **understand the overall mission and direction** - put your feet in the right place - **and make the tough calls** - stand firm" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Pick up the responsibility to "deliver bad news", rather than "hiding from [deliver] bad news" or "passing [the] responsibility to others" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Do so promptly, "balance [my] empathy and humane tendencies [with] the requirements of [my] job ([being] authentic and honest)" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Challenges and challenging times provide me with opportunities "to live up to the authentic ideals [that I] have chosen for" myself, "to act as the leader [that I] strive to be," even when doing so makes me uncomfortable or takes me through a painful process \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 25-26]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- As I "grow into the leader that [I] aspire to be," I do so "one [painful or] uncomfortable moment at a time" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Ask myself if my constituents perceive me to be consistent, truthful, trustworthy, and authentic \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- This question matters especially if I am asking people to follow me in a particular direction for the greater good (or well-being) of the institution (or the larger community at heart), and the welfare of those people, especially if that direction is not "an ideal fit for their own ambitions and plans" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
		* If the direction is not for the well-being of the community/institution, they will not get behind me \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ **"Leading any complex institution is a marathon, not a sprint. You need to think in the long term"** \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Build trust with your constituents with long-term thinking, so that when I have to make touch decisions, they would not doubt that I would avoid short-term thinking only. Else, my effectiveness as a leader would be undermined \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 26]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Organizations, such as universities and corporations, have internal constituents (e.g., employees) and external constituents (shareholders, alumni, donors, students/parents, research funders, board of trustees, and board of directors) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 27]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A united team does not imply that the team would always have an unanimous agreement on everything (or every issue). It implies that the team would "back the leadership 100 percent, even when the circumstances shifted slightly and we adjusted course" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 27]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- When the leadership and the important constituents are fully committed at the start, even when individuals have doubts and uncertainties, so that they can act collaboratively, share ideas and vision prior to them being fully shaped \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 27]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Although the board may ask tough questions and challenge the leadership, once a decision is made, the board and leadership team are joined" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 28]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Develop a trust relationship [with constituents] by being available, open to questions, and candid in my responses" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 28]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Demonstrate [to people] that rational decision making [is] my modus operandi" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Let the insights that I share with my constituents "form the basis of a trust relationship going forward" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Be open and trustworthy with my constituents \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Help my "corporation develop trust relationships with [its] customers," and avoid misleading (or deceiving) them "about product capabilities, availability, or reliability". Else, it would "lose customers and damage their reputations, making it harder to recover by replacing the lost customers" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 29]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A corporation must "[go] beyond the more minimal standard of honesty demanded by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Do the shareholders believe that the management team is assessing its challenges and opportunities?" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 30]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ To avoid decadence and jaded attitude in tenured faculty, remind them that their reputation would erode if they do not "go the extra mile, push [themselves] harder, take on new challenges, and make the tough decisions" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 31]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Avoid cutting corners, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term well-being of the corporation, "undermining [my] peers," and being ruthless \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 31]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- "The constant change of environment and the need to compete for every rung up the latter also reinforces normative behavior" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 31]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Much of your career path is about knowing where you're headed today, but not necessarily knowing the final destination. It's not fixed yet. You're creating that destination - and yourself - as you go. Some core values may be built in you when you're really young, but so much more develops over time, from your own life experiences, watching other people, or reading great biographies. It's always less painful to learn from others when you can" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 32]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Gordon Bell challenged John L. Hennessy to personally commit to technological innovations that he had been part of, and co-found a spin-off (i.e., start-up using technology transferred from his research lab) to commercialize those technologies. Dr. Bell posited that technologies developed during transformative projects should be further developed commercially (by the spin-off) \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 33]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "It is not easy to alter one's set course" \cite[\S2 Authenticity and Trust: The Essential Ingredients for Effective Leadership, pp. 33]{Hennessy2018a}.



##	Chapter 3, Leadership as Service: Understanding Who Works for Whom

"It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership."
\- [Nelson Mandela](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/382246-it-is-better-to-lead-from-behind-and-to-put)
