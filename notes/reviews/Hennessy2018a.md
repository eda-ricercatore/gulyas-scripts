+ Walter Isaacson describes Dr. John L. Hennessy as a creative leader, who can combine wisdom with intelligence and critical/analytical reasoning \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy "distill[ed] ten core concepts" "from various leadership styles" that he learned from, and present these "abstract principles[/concepts] ... with insightful stories and memorable anecdotes [to] bring them to life" \cite[\S Forward, pp. ix]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ He has the humility to appreciate the opinions of others \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ A healthy ego does not require ignoring second-guessers and have unwavering conviction about everything, most things, or even many things. This can circumvent or mitigate the combination of ego and insecurity by being humble and confident/secure \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Steve Jobs may be brash and aggresssive, but he has the humility and wisdom to "listen intently" to others and process their opinions \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Being humble requires authenticity, and avoid giving "the pretense of humility" \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- However, Benjamin Franklin argues that by wearing a mask of a particular virtue (or leadership skill), "we become the mask that we wear" (quote from Shakespeare's Prince Hal, which is used by Benjamin Franklin) \cite[\S Forward, pp. x]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Humility provides the foundation for other leadership "principles"/skills, such as empathy, "leadership as service" (think servant leadership), and collaboration \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Being humble helps us to "listen to [others], find common ground," and collaborate \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Collaborative teams have been more productive than singular inventors \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Storytelling is an important leadership skill \cite[\S Forward, pp. xi]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Leadership is about creating a narrative," and storytelling enables a leader to shape the narrative \cite[\S Forward, pp. xii]{Hennessy2018a}.

##	Introduction section

+ "I hoped that I could succeed, if I approached the job with humility about my own skills, a scientist's respect for the facts, and a stellar team." - Dr. John L. Hennessy \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 4]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Dr. John L. Hennessy classifies aspects of effective leadership into the following categories: fundamental principles of good leadership (e.g., humility, authenticity, service, and empathy), steadfastness to hold on to these principles, a methodology for institutional transformation (by using courage and the aforementioned fundamental principles), and a methodology for transformational change (i.e., taking a great institution to new heights) \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 6]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Build a determined team around a compelling vision of change for an old institution, and take actions to ensure that the transformation has lasting impact \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Leaders of organizations should focus on the well-being of organizations/governments/countries that they serve in, and the well-being of their members/employees/students and customers/clients/citizens \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ There is a knowledge gap regarding how to lead organizations through necessary transformations \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "Our world is changing at an ever-increasing pace" - Dr. John L. Hennessy \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Hence, organizations [and individuals] have to renew themselves with respect to changes and megatrends and macro-trends \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 7]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Prepare future, emerging, and junior leaders to address "the changing nature of leadership in the twenty-first century" \cite[\S Introduction, pp. 8]{Hennessy2018a}.



##	Chapter 1, Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership

"It is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err."
\- [Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4794-it-is-unwise-to-be-too-sure-of-one-s-own)
+ Confidence arises from humility, rather than from ego \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- Avoid wearing a mask of confidence, phony bravado, or misplaced confidence \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
	- **"Arrogance sees only our strengths, ignores our weaknesses, and overlooks the strengths of others, therefore leaving us vulnerable to catastrophic mistakes. Humility shows us where our weaknesses lie so we can compensate for them. Humility makes us earn our confidence" \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.**
+ Provide career-enabling educational opportunities for my descendants \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ "It is likely there are students who know more about almost any subject than you do." \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
+ Leaders need the expertise and assistance of their team members to succeed; hence, **"start by admitting what [I] don't know, learn what [my] team members know, and humbly asking for their support"** \cite[\S1 Humility: The Basis for Effective Leadership, pp. 9]{Hennessy2018a}.
