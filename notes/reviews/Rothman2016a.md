##	Foreward by Ron Jeffries

We can choose to take any of the three actions per project in our project portfolio (pp. xi):
+ commit to the project
+ kill the project
+ transform the project
	- For a project that should not be terminated, but is lacking resources and personnel from the organization to commit to the project so that it has a chance to be successful.
	- Re-consider what to do with this project, so that it can be transformed


For projects remaining in the project portfolio, including orphan internal projects, use the suggested ranking dimensions to rank them (pp. xi).



##	Foreward by Tim Lister


More important than efficient project management and improving the process with workflow automation, finish the valuable projects prior to finishing other projects (pp. xiii).

Focus on effectiveness over efficiency (pp. xiii).

Transform struggling projects with meaningful value to have more acceptable risks (pp. xiii). 

Project portfolio management involves setting priorities and adapting them to changing needs, opportunities, and requirements, while avoiding being reactionary/reactive to pressures from clients, customers, and other stakeholders (pp. xiii). 



##	Preface

"Project portfolio management is the way of organizing, seeing, and ranking the work your team, groups, business unit, or organization has to do." It needs execution of the current prototype of the software/hardware (i.e., simulation models for hardware or computer systems), "tested features", and collectible metrics (pp. xvii).

"The hard part of \[project\] portfolio management" "is sticking with \[difficult\] decisions until it's time to reevaluate the \[project\] portfolio," rather than the data analytics involved in project portfolio management (pp. xviii).







##	Chapter 1, Meet Your Project Porfolio

Consider the project "portfolio as a pipeline of potential work" (pp. 3).

Finishing the implementation of features gives product teams flexibility to finish work.

Multitasking between different projects hinders the the productivity of software developers (pp. 3).

Project portfolio is a means for the company, organization, or team to get things done, and is not one of the end goals of these entitites. It is "a pipeline of potential work" that flows through teams. It helps me make appropriate decisions to fulfill the needs of my stakeholders, such as customers and research advisors. One of the best practices for project portfolio management involves using adaptive, lean, and/or agile approaches (pp. 3). 

Lean and/or agile approaches for project portfolio management enable the review of small/sizeable portions of valuable work after such work has been completed to provide regular/frequent feedback. This enables the teams to adapt their immediate and near-term goals to adjust to needs reflected by the reviews and feedback (pp. 4).
	- the lean and agile approaches enable management to (pp. 5-6):
		- eliminate waste
		- discover and eliminate roadblocks to throughput
		- balancing the workload across teams and individuals
		- optimizing for different/multiple goals and objectives of the organization, rather than just a subset of it
		- "\[finishing\] valuable features in short time periods"
		- reduce the set of partially completed work in my project portfolio  

Proposed procedure or workflow for project portfolio management, which involves project creation, project evaluation, project ranking (or ranking of projects), collaboration on projects, iterate on projects, evolve the goals of the projects, and measure (select metrics for evaluating project success, collect data for these metrics, and automatically analyze this data statistically and computationally) (pp. 4):
+ use an appointment calendar to schedule time allocations (e.g., hours, days, weeks, and months) for tasks that need to be completed for projects
+ create and maintain a "list of collected \[tasks\] in rank order" for the list of projects in your project portfolio
+ for each task that belongs to at least one existing/understaffed project, decide to carry out only one of the following decisions - the commit/kill/transform decision:
	- commit to a team
	- transform, followed by commiting to a team 
	- kill, or parking lot
+ use data analytics/science to optimize the scheduling (i.e., address the organization's backlog for product development) and commit/kill/transform decision making process to optimize the maximum value to the organization/community and complete "strategically important work" on time (pp. 5)
	- View the resource and time commitments to manage project interactions, assignment of personnel to tasks/projects, "and the general risk and value of each project" (pp. 5)
+ update the list of collected tasks, and the corresponding result of the commit/kill/transform decision for each task  
+ enable high-level (i.e., yearly and monthly) and detailed views (i.e., weekly and daily) of the project portfolios; the high-level view enables people to determine which team is committed to which project, and the detailed view enables managers to determine which team should be assigned to a particular project and determine "when a \[product development\] team \[needs\] urgent support work" (pp. 6)
	- the high-level view enables people to see when a team starts a project and when it is expected to finish the project, and also includes a list of understaffed projects/work (pp. 6)
		* for understaffed work/projects (pp. 7):
			+ use data analytics to help teams measure their productivity, and improve their estimation of when they can finish their project; this is used to improve task scheduling for project portfolio management
			+ re-evaluate project portfolio to determine why important/urgent projects have yet to start
			+ based on current and emerging market and business needs, determine team assignment (or update preferred team assignment) to a given understaffed project, whether we should start a project, and whether we should transform a project 
		* avoid assigning people to projects, since (pp. 5 and 6)
	- team managers can use the high-level view/perspective to help senior and mid-level management view the responsibilities of each product team and use the low-level view/perspective to match businessexpectations with reality (pp. 9) 
	- the detailed view, or low-level view, shows the project (and feature) that each person is assigned to, and the set of features for each project (pp. 8)
		* "\[This\] helps everyone see what everyone else is doing" (pp. 8)  
+ "this improves the throughput of the organization" (pp. 11), from Chapter 2

The proposed procedure or workflow for project portfolio management requires transparency in the organization (pp. 10, 11).




A "Big Visible Chart" visually displays the project portfolio to an organization's members/employees, and highlights the responsibilities of each project team. This also indicates, by implication or otherwise, the tasks that each project team is not responsible for (pp. 5).


The proposed procedure enables the technical management to decide (pp. 5):
+ when a team can start working on a task/project
+ when a project should be completed, be terminated, and release the owning team(s) to work on other projects
+ when a project should be transformed, and assign a team to the modified/changed project
+ when it is difficult to make a commit/kill/transform decision, the project portfolio provides a visual for stakeholders during "[negotiation about] which project to do when"

Project portfolio management "is context dependent", since the project portfolio is affected by project life cycles, budgeting process, and roadmap creation and usage (pp. 5).



Suggestions:
+ Use  a two-week timebox for feature development, a week timebox for support, and move on to another feature (pp. 8).
+ When you assign people to projects, rather than teams to projects, people do not work in stable teams. Project portfolios using this management style make it hard to visualize projects (and features) of greater priority (pp. 8).
	- When features take longer to complete than the allocated timebox (or time period), the entire project portfolio have to be rearranged/rejiggered (pp. 8).
	- Hence, schedule and assign projects to teams, rather than individuals (pp. 8). 



##	Chapter 2, See Your Future


From notes for Chapter 1, "The proposed procedure or workflow for project portfolio management requires transparency in the organization (pp. 10, 11)."
+ this transparency help individuals and teams focus on the most important work, and avoid multitasking and being "distracted with 'bright shiny object' syndrome" (pp. 11)
+ "people and teams can deliver what the organization needs, when the organization needs it" (pp. 11)
+ transparency also clarifies decision making about the work, projects and features, that each team starts and completes (pp. 11)
	- this provides "maximum flexibility" to managers (pp. 11)
	- this help managers be more responsive to business needs (pp. 11)
	- This limits the number of active projects, and reduces competition between teams for the same higher-performing individuals. This leads to better completion rate of projects, which reduces the number of active projects in the porject portfolio and allows new projects to start (pp. 11).
	- this improves the throughput of the organization (pp. 11)


Motivating scenarios for using project portfolios with the suggested/proposed procedure or workflow (pp. 12):
+ emergency projects
+ required immediate response "to projects in progress and fixes"
+ lots of "emergency fixes"
+ too many projects in progress, such that we cannot determine when each project would complete/finish
+ difficulties in finding the "right" personnel for each project
	- moving personnel between project teams do not significantly improve the situation
+ when projects are released from the project portfolio, teams do not feel that they have actually completed the projects
+ finishing some projects is a surprise to management
	- some projects are not "congruent with \[the\] corporate strategy"
+ can't tell the status of the active projects (i.e. projects in progress)
	- by the time management recognizes that a project team needs help or in danger, it is in a terrible (or even hopeless) state  
+ assignments of experts (highly-skilled professionals) to multiple projects and fixes, especially for finishing projects 
+ poor throughput to completing projects
	- huge "cost of delay"

Not having the courage and wisdom to make decisions in project portfolio management affects the organization's throughput and adds problems to scheduling, personnel assignment, and budgeting (pp. 14).

##	Notes from \cite{Rothman2007}











##	Notes from \cite{Rothman2005}


Preface:
+ pp. 5, good managers allow team members to take up different leadership roles, and demonstrate leadership in their tasks and roles; they distribute leaderships across the team, rather than consolidate/centralize the leadership 

Introduction:
+ pp. 6, "managers amplify the work of others"... hence, managers should seek to improve team morale and productivity


Week 1:
+ pp. 12, "people are not fungible producters or full-time equivalents (FTEs)"... We should not assume that people are ***mutually interchangeable***.
+ pp. 12, micromanagement is "productivity-reducing interference at worst"; managers should avoid "prying into people's private lives and discuss their private decisions"
+ pp. 14, "don't offer help if you can't deliver"
+ pp. 15, management technqiues:
	- management behind closed doors
	- management by walking around and listening (MBWAL), which requires "cultivating a curious mind", lots of observation and reflection, "and questioning the meaning of what \[I\] see"
+ pp. 19, assigning an individual to two tasks, rather than two projects or teams, can improve productivity when any of the tasks faces delays due to bottlenecks or requires waiting for resources and features from other people; people can switch to the other assigned task while waiting for the resources and features to be deliverd, and/or subconsciously think about problems encountered in working on the delayed/halted task
	- do not assign people to more than two tasks, since task switching (or context switching) would slow down their productivity when they work on a particular task for a significant time slot/window.
+ pp. 21, use project portfolio management to determine list of tasks to be completed by each product team and how these tasks add value to the organization, so that we can "make good decisions about priority, what work to do, and what work not to do"
	- ***this can help reduce the amount of unsanctioned, unfunded, and unneeded work to be co-opt into current/active projects***
	- track the following types of tasks
		* project work, with start and end dates, and specifically meets the goals of the organizations
			+ the goals of the organizations should be publicly displayed, so that people can view these accessible goals and help team/product managers access if their tasks are aligned with the goals of the company (pp. 28)
		* ad hoc work, which appears as crises, unanticipated requests, or unplanned work
		* periodic work that occurs at predictable intervals
		* ongoing work to "\[keep\] the business and operation running"
		* management work regarding the planning and organization for remaining/other work, such as:
			+ budgeting
			+ reporting
			+ influencing
			+ creating value through the work of the group
	- create a ***big visible chart*** of the list of tasks/work
	- clearly prioritize more valuable work, or work that brings more value to the organization and aligns with the goals of the organization (pp. 23)
		* "match the \[task/\]work to the goals" of the organization (pp. 28)
		* avoid requiring/demanding individuals or teams to produce reports and other documentation that needs/requires scads of time, which is wasted if and when the requester(s) move on, move up, or move out and the report (and other documentation) is no longer needed (pp. 28)
	- iterate
		* adapt and adjust the project portfolio, and task/work schedule, and resource allocation to changing goals and priorities of the organization (pp. 28)
		* update the ***big visible chart*** of the list of tasks/work, so that it "creates shared ownership of the projects" "and \[allow\] people \[to recognize\] patterns and problems as well as solutions to these problems" (pp. 28)
	- understand resistance














Week 2:
+ pp. 23, "chaos hides problems" that need to be addressed
+ pp. 27, ***"focus on the funded work"***
+ pp. 29, differences between product teams and IT (support) groups that support products and/or services of the company/organization:
	- software produced by product teams lead to revenue generation, and hopefully profit generation
		* How does the work of this product team "contribute to generating revenue"?
		* How does the work of this product team "attract new customers and \[retain/\]keep existing customers"?
	- define the mission of IT support groups and their strategically important work
		* How does the work of this IT support group facilitate the company carry out business operations, or perform these operations more efficiently and/or effectively?
		* How does the work of this IT support group affect the company's profit margin (or bottom line)?
		* "How does the work of this group support the business unit's ability to generate revenue and continue business operations?"
 + pp. 30, categorize all projects as follows:
 	- projects and work that will be continued
 	- projects and work that need to be stopped, and be placed in the "not-to-do" list since they provide no value to anybody in the organization
 	- projects and work that may be important, but are not a good fit to your product team/group
 		* since these projects and work cannot be discarded, "transition \[them\] to a more appropriate group"
	- projects and work that senior management and team managers do not know which team should be assigned to each of these projects
		* investigate further before canceling or transitioning these projects
	- ***make conscious decisions regarding reach project, and communicate such decisions to senior management of the organization and other stakeholders***
+ pp. 31, for career paths in technical and management, provide equivalent or comparable positions (in terms of seniority, remuneration packages, and benefits) in these paths so that engineers, software developers, and other technical professionals can alternate between these paths and explore different career opportunities
	- tackle the stigma and perceptions that professionals who re-choose a technical role are moving backwards professionally, since this can help such professionals and teams that they managed alleviate their stress levels
	- ***career progression for many successful technical managers are nonlinear***
	- ***technical management is about working with people, not technology***
	- Questions to think about when considering applying for or accepting technical management roles, or leaving such roles:
		* Affirmative responses to the following questions reflect greater comfort in technical leadership roles than people leadership roles.
			+ "Do I want to control more of the technical decisions?"
			+ "Am I more interested in fixing technical problems than people problems?" 
		* Affirmative responses to the following questions reflect greater comfort in people leadership roles than technical leadership roles.
			+ "Do I like working with people?"
			+ "Do I like coaching and mentoring people?"
			+ "Am I willing to learn how to provide feedback and have difficult conversations with people when I need to?"
	- Becoming a great manager requires lots of practice.
+ pp. 34, match the roles with the people
	- "match strengths and talents with roles"
	- "provide feedback"
	- project team leaders should create an environment that team members can succeed in (pp. 35):
		* communicate priorities to help team members with their decision making about what to do when
		* help team members understand the expectations of team leaders and management, and get them to paraphrase these expectations
		* clearly communicate task assignments, including constraints and specific boundaries about the work
		* discuss options for gaining any necessary skills
		* examine the following environmental factors:
			+ procedures
			+ measures
			+ rewards
			+ system problems
				- avoid labeling environmental and system problems (e.g., leadership and management choices to incur technical debt at the expense of faster throughput in project/feature completion) as individual problems (pp. 36)
	- pp. 34 and 36, prior to labeling an individual as a poor performer, do the following:
		* "set clear expectations"
		* "set reasonable interim deliverables"
		* "communicate satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the quality of results"
	- pp. 36, hire the best
		* "When hiring, the greater the span of influence for the position, the more critical the decision."
	- pp. 37, "analyze the job"
	- pp. 37, "source candidates"
	- pp. 37, "winnow the candidates"
	- pp. 37, "develop behavior description questions" using "Tell me about a time when..." as opposed to "What would you do if..."
	- pp. 37, "phone screen before in-person interviewing" 
	- pp. 37, "develop an audition"
	- pp. 38, "interview candidates with an interview team"
	- pp. 38, "involve as many people as possible when selecting new team members and team leaders"
	- pp. 38, "listen to the interview team's assessment"
	- pp. 38, "check references"
	- pp. 38, "extend an offer"	 
+ pp. 39, "plan to integrate new team members", or plan for the transition to integrate the same people into new roles:
	- "create and use a checklist for new hires"
	- "spend time setting the context on the first day"
	- "assign a buddy"
	- "expect to re-form teams"
