##	Foreward by Ron Jeffries

We can choose to take any of the three actions per project in our project portfolio (pp. xi):
+ commit to the project
+ kill the project
+ transform the project
	- For a project that should not be terminated, but is lacking resources and personnel from the organization to commit to the project so that it has a chance to be successful.
	- Re-consider what to do with this project, so that it can be transformed


For projects remaining in the project portfolio, including orphan internal projects, use the suggested ranking dimensions to rank them (pp. xi).



##	Foreward by Tim Lister


More important than efficient project management and improving the process with workflow automation, finish the valuable projects prior to finishing other projects (pp. xiii).

Focus on effectiveness over efficiency (pp. xiii).

Transform struggling projects with meaningful value to have more acceptable risks (pp. xiii). 

Project portfolio management involves setting priorities and adapting them to changing needs, opportunities, and requirements, while avoiding being reactionary/reactive to pressures from clients, customers, and other stakeholders (pp. xiii). 



##	Preface

"Project portfolio management is the way of organizing, seeing, and ranking the work your team, groups, business unit, or organization has to do." It needs execution of the current prototype of the software/hardware (i.e., simulation models for hardware or computer systems), "tested features", and collectible metrics (pp. xvii).

"The hard part of \[project\] portfolio management" "is sticking with \[difficult\] decisions until it's time to reevaluate the \[project\] portfolio," rather than the data analytics involved in project portfolio management (pp. xviii).







##	Chapter 1, Meet Your Project Porfolio

Consider the project "portfolio as a pipeline of potential work" (pp. 3).

Finishing the implementation of features gives product teams flexibility to finish work.

Multitasking between different projects hinders the the productivity of software developers (pp. 3).

Project portfolio is a means for the company, organization, or team to get things done, and is not one of the end goals of these entitites. It is "a pipeline of potential work" that flows through teams. It helps me make appropriate decisions to fulfill the needs of my stakeholders, such as customers and research advisors. One of the best practices for project portfolio management involves using adaptive, lean, and/or agile approaches (pp. 3). 

Lean and/or agile approaches for project portfolio management enable the review of small/sizeable portions of valuable work after such work has been completed to provide regular/frequent feedback. This enables the teams to adapt their immediate and near-term goals to adjust to needs reflected by the reviews and feedback (pp. 4).
	- the lean and agile approaches enable management to (pp. 5-6):
		- eliminate waste
		- discover and eliminate roadblocks to throughput
		- balancing the workload across teams and individuals
		- optimizing for different/multiple goals and objectives of the organization, rather than just a subset of it
		- "\[finishing\] valuable features in short time periods"
		- reduce the set of partially completed work in my project portfolio  

Proposed procedure or workflow for project portfolio management, which involves project creation, project evaluation, project ranking (or ranking of projects), collaboration on projects, iterate on projects, evolve the goals of the projects, and measure (select metrics for evaluating project success, collect data for these metrics, and automatically analyze this data statistically and computationally) (pp. 4):
+ use an appointment calendar to schedule time allocations (e.g., hours, days, weeks, and months) for tasks that need to be completed for projects
+ create and maintain a "list of collected \[tasks\] in rank order" for the list of projects in your project portfolio
+ for each task that belongs to at least one existing/understaffed project, decide to carry out only one of the following decisions - the commit/kill/transform decision:
	- commit to a team
	- transform, followed by commiting to a team 
	- kill, or parking lot
+ use data analytics/science to optimize the scheduling (i.e., address the organization's backlog for product development) and commit/kill/transform decision making process to optimize the maximum value to the organization/community and complete "strategically important work" on time (pp. 5)
	- View the resource and time commitments to manage project interactions, assignment of personnel to tasks/projects, "and the general risk and value of each project" (pp. 5)
+ update the list of collected tasks, and the corresponding result of the commit/kill/transform decision for each task  
+ enable high-level (i.e., yearly and monthly) and detailed views (i.e., weekly and daily) of the project portfolios; the high-level view enables people to determine which team is committed to which project, and the detailed view enables managers to determine which team should be assigned to a particular project and determine "when a \[product development\] team \[needs\] urgent support work" (pp. 6)
	- the high-level view enables people to see when a team starts a project and when it is expected to finish the project, and also includes a list of understaffed projects/work (pp. 6)
		* for understaffed work/projects (pp. 7):
			+ use data analytics to help teams measure their productivity, and improve their estimation of when they can finish their project; this is used to improve task scheduling for project portfolio management
			+ re-evaluate project portfolio to determine why important/urgent projects have yet to start
			+ based on current and emerging market and business needs, determine team assignment (or update preferred team assignment) to a given understaffed project, whether we should start a project, and whether we should transform a project 
		* avoid assigning people to projects, since (pp. 5 and 6)
	- the detailed view, or low-level view, shows the project (and feature) that each person is assigned to, and the set of features for each project (pp. 8)
		* "\[This\] helps everyone see what everyone else is doing" (pp. 8)  





A "Big Visible Chart" visually displays the project portfolio to an organization's members/employees, and highlights the responsibilities of each project team. This also indicates, by implication or otherwise, the tasks that each project team is not responsible for (pp. 5).


The proposed procedure enables the technical management to decide (pp. 5):
+ when a team can start working on a task/project
+ when a project should be completed, be terminated, and release the owning team(s) to work on other projects
+ when a project should be transformed, and assign a team to the modified/changed project
+ when it is difficult to make a commit/kill/transform decision, the project portfolio provides a visual for stakeholders during "[negotiation about] which project to do when"

Project portfolio management "is context dependent", since the project portfolio is affected by project life cycles, budgeting process, and roadmap creation and usage (pp. 5).



Suggestions:
+ Use  a two-week timebox for feature development, a week timebox for support, and move on to another feature (pp. 8).
