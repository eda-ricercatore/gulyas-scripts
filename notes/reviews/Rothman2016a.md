##	Foreward by Ron Jeffries

We can choose to take any of the three actions per project in our project portfolio (pp. xi):
+ commit to the project
+ kill the project
+ transform the project
	- For a project that should not be terminated, but is lacking resources and personnel from the organization to commit to the project so that it has a chance to be successful.
	- Re-consider what to do with this project, so that it can be transformed


For projects remaining in the project portfolio, including orphan internal projects, use the suggested ranking dimensions to rank them (pp. xi).



##	Foreward by Tim Lister


More important than efficient project management and improving the process with workflow automation, finish the valuable projects prior to finishing other projects (pp. xiii).

Focus on effectiveness over efficiency (pp. xiii).

Transform struggling projects with meaningful value to have more acceptable risks (pp. xiii). 

Project portfolio management involves setting priorities and adapting them to changing needs, opportunities, and requirements, while avoiding being reactionary/reactive to pressures from clients, customers, and other stakeholders (pp. xiii). 



##	Preface

"Project portfolio management is the way of organizing, seeing, and ranking the work your team, groups, business unit, or organization has to do." It needs execution of the current prototype of the software/hardware (i.e., simulation models for hardware or computer systems), "tested features", and collectible metrics (pp. xvii).

"The hard part of \[project\] portfolio management" "is sticking with \[difficult\] decisions until it's time to reevaluate the \[project\] portfolio," rather than the data analytics involved in project portfolio management (pp. xviii).







##	Chapter 1, Meet Your Project Porfolio

Consider the project "portfolio as a pipeline of potential work" (pp. 3).

Finishing the implementation of features gives product teams flexibility to finish work.

Multitasking between different projects hinders the the productivity of software developers (pp. 3).

Project portfolio is a means for the company, organization, or team to get things done, and is not one of the end goals of these entitites. It is "a pipeline of potential work" that flows through teams. It helps me make appropriate decisions to fulfill the needs of my stakeholders, such as customers and research advisors. One of the best practices for project portfolio management involves using adaptive, lean, and/or agile approaches (pp. 3). 

Lean and/or agile approaches for project portfolio management enable the review of small/sizeable portions of valuable work after such work has been completed to provide regular/frequent feedback. This enables the teams to adapt their immediate and near-term goals to adjust to needs reflected by the reviews and feedback (pp. 4).

Proposed procedure or workflow for project portfolio management, which involves project creation, project evaluation, project ranking (or ranking of projects), collaboration on projects, iterate on projects, evolve the goals of the projects, and measure (select metrics for evaluating project success, collect data for these metrics, and automatically analyze this data statistically and computationally) (pp. 4):
+ use an appointment calendar to schedule time allocations (e.g., hours, days, weeks, and months) for tasks that need to be completed for projects
+ create and maintain a "list of collected \[tasks\] in rank order" for the list of projects in your project portfolio
+ for each task that belongs to at least one project, decide to carry out only one of the following decisions - the commit/kill/transform decision:
	- commit to a team
	- transform, followed by commiting to a team 
	- kill, or parking lot
+ use data analytics/science to optimize the scheduling and commit/kill/transform decision making process to optimize the maximum value to the organization/community
+ update the list of collected tasks, and the corresponding result of the commit/kill/transform decision for each task  

A "Big Visible Chart" visually displays the project portfolio to an organization's members/employees, and highlights the responsibilities of each project team. This also indicates, by implication or otherwise, the tasks that each project team is not responsible for (pp. 5).


The proposed procedure enables the technical management to decide (pp. 5):
+ when a team can start working on a task/project
+ when a project should be completed, be terminated, and release the owning team(s) to work on other projects
+ when a project should be transformed, and assign a team to the modified/changed project
+ when it is difficult to make a commit/kill/transform decision, the project portfolio provides a visual for stakeholders during "[negotiation about] which project to do when"
