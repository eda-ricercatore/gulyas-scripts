##	Introduction

+ pp. 4, "I come from a family of thinkerers."
+ pp. 4, "approaching each job with the mind-set of a thinkerer, rolling up his sleeves and making it work no matter the circumstance"
+ pp. 4, "Maybe it's a thinkerer's curiosity that turned me into a scientist. Early on, physics allowed me to explore the sprockets and gears of the universe and the very forces that control our lives. Looking for more challenges, I turned later to the complexities of networks and data. For a vigilant asker-of-questions, I've chosen the right corner of the scientific world to call home. As long as a line inquiry is based on numbers -- the more the merrier -- I can pursue it doggedly, following its scent through the maze of data now available to researchers in our hyperconnected, technological world. Hunting down an answer inevitably leads to more questions, new possibilities that hover like gnats on the periphery of any research I conduct. I try to swat them away and stay focused on the task at hand, but I'm not that different from the kid I once was, stubbornly asking `Why?' in response to... well, pretty much anything. It is the quest for answers that gets me up in the morning and keeps me up at night."
+ pp. 5, examine the interconnectedness about complex systems, where and how links form in these networks
+ pp. 5, use data science (approaches) as "a framework for understanding the essence of connectednss," and to create/use "models and tools" to perform scientific analyses within this data science framework to improve our knowledge of the world
+ pp. 6, "“Why are there a mere handful of superstars in any field?"
+ pp. 6, "Add these to the hundreds of other questions about success, achievement, and reputation that seem, like the sun’s temperature, impossible to pin down. Is it our performance that pushes us up the corporate ladder? Do we get less or more creative over our lifetimes? Should we collaborate or compete with superstars? How do networks—social and professional—affect our access to success?”"
