#	Notes About *Python*

##	Differences between *Python 3.x* and *Python 2.y*

The `print` statement in *Python 2.y* has been replaced by the
	`print()` function in *Python 3.x*.
	A pair of parentheses, or round brackets, are used in the `print()`
	function to print the string within the parentheses.
	The `print` statement needs to be appended by a string, and these
	tokens (the `print` statement and the string) are whitespace
	delimited \cite{vanRossum2017}.


##	Syntax Rules Regarding Identifiers

*Python* identifiers for variables, functions, classes, and modules
	have to be alphanumeric and can include underscores
	\cite[from \S Python Basic Syntax]{Mohtashim2017}
	\cite[\S2.3 Identifiers and keywords]{DrakeJr2016f}
	\cite[\S2.3 Identifiers and keywords]{DrakeJr2016a}.
	Otherwise, the *Python* interpreter would report a syntax error,
	since the syntax is invalid.
	These identifiers are case sensitive and cannot be *Python*
	keywords [ParewaLabsPvtLtdStaff20XY, \S "Python Keywords and Identifier"].
