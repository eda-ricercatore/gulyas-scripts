#	Notes About *Python*

##	Differences between *Python 3.x* and *Python 2.y*

The `print` statement in *Python 2.y* has been replaced by the
	`print()` function in *Python 3.x*.
	A pair of parentheses, or round brackets, are used in the `print()`
	function to print the string within the parentheses.
	The `print` statement needs to be appended by a string, and these
	tokens (the `print` statement and the string) are whitespace
	delimited \cite{vanRossum2017}.

Comparing Python 3.x to Python 2.y, the former has significant
		differences in printing information (to standard output)
		\cite{vanRossum2017}.
	This can cause compatibility problems between different versions
		of Python in a given Python software. 


##	Syntax Rules Regarding Identifiers

*Python* identifiers for variables, functions, classes, and modules
	have to be alphanumeric and can include underscores
	\cite[from \S Python Basic Syntax]{Mohtashim2017}
	\cite[\S2.3 Identifiers and keywords]{DrakeJr2016f}
	\cite[\S2.3 Identifiers and keywords]{DrakeJr2016a}.
	Otherwise, the *Python* interpreter would report a syntax error,
	since the syntax is invalid.
	These identifiers are case sensitive and cannot be *Python*
	keywords [ParewaLabsPvtLtdStaff20XY, \S "Python Keywords and Identifier"].

##	Importing Python Classes and Modules

Tasks that I can do:
+ Create and define a class, and use static methods in the class
	(within the same script). 
+ Use static methods of a class, from another *Python* script.
+ Create, define, and use my own *Python* modules, from any *Python*
	script.

See [example to import Python modules and classes](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/s-import).



Tasks that I want to do, but can't yet (or have yet to try):
+ Create, define, and use my own *Python* packages, from any *Python*
	script.
	Determine the importance and usefulness packages, with respect to
	modules.






Note: "A module is a file containing *Python* definitions and statements."
	\cite[\S6 Modules]{Brandl2017a} \cite[\S6 Modules]{Brandl2017}
	\cite[Importing Modules: Module? What's a Module?]{Thurlow2012}.
	**This is different from how I define modules in *C++* and *Java*.**

	Python classes and modules:
+ Abstraction of classes and modules, pp. 109--158, 173--202
+ Modules and The Standard Library, pp. 203--254
+ Summaries: pp. 547--574




Pages in \cite[Expert Python Programming]{Ziade2008} that deal with
	importing Python classes and modules (Not helpful):
+ Naming, (pp. 91--116
	- Application of naming to (pp. 92): 
		* Variables: constants and public/private variables
		* Functions and methods
		* Properties
		* Classes
		* Modules
		* Packages
+ Packages, (pp. 117--165)
+ Documentation, (pp. 223--250)



##	Design Decisions

Use either keyword arguments or positional arguments in my
	implementation of *Python* methods to process input parameters.
