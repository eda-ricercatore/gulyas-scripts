#	Enabling Seamless Interoperability Between Programming Languages

There exists software and libraries for enabling seamless
	interoperability between programming languages.

To enable an object, for an object-oriented (OO) program/software
	written in an object-oriented programming language (OOPL), to be
	shared (accessed/modified) by another software, I need to use
	the following:
+ language bindings
	- Language binding libraries:
	- Automated binding libraries
	- Binding libraries
	- Binding generators [or binding synthesis]
+ Wrapper libraries (or library wrappers)
+ Software frameworks (programming framework): Software framework design
+ Glue code
+ Language interoperability
+ Foreign function interface (FFI)
+ Run-time interoperability (or cross-language interoperability)
+ Cross-language interoperability (or run-time interoperability)
	
The aforementioned objects are not considered portable objects, since
	they are not necessarily shared between computers.
	

For example, I can use the following software.
+ *Boost.Python*
	- \cite[Boost C++ Libraries: Documentation: Boost Library Documentation: Boost 1.62.0 Library Documentation: Boost Libraries]{Abrahams2015}; updated \url{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html}
	- \cite{Dawes2015b}
	- \cite{Abrahams2015a}
+ *SWIG*

+ *SIP*
	- Automated binding library
	- Language binding libraries
	- "*SIP* is a tool for automatically generating Python bindings
		for *C* and *C++* libraries." 
		\cite{RiverbankComputingLimitedStaff2016}
	- Reference: Wikipedia contributors, "SIP (software)," in *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia: Computer programming tools*, Wikimedia Foundation, San Francisco, CA, August 10, 2016. Available online at: [SIP (Software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIP_(software)); last accessed on October 21, 2016.
+ *Machinist*
	- Reference: Tom Hyer, "Machinist," Atlassian Pty Ltd, San Francisco, CA, March 5, 2015. Available online at: [Machinist](https://bitbucket.org/hyer/machinist/); October 21, 2016 was the last accessed date \cite{Hyer2015}.
+ *PyCXX*
	- *C++* facilities for developing *Python* extensions (to *C++* software).
	- \cite{Scott2016a}
