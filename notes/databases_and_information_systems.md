##	Database Management Systems

A database is a collection of data that is systematically organized
	for access, storage, and processing \cite{DictionaryDotComStaff2018}.

A "general-purpose" database management system (DBMS) is a software system that enables people to create, maintain, and access databases \cite{WikipediaContributors2018r}.




##	Database Design

cite this!!!

+ Database design is the process of organizing data/information, using a
	database model.
+ Database design involves creating the ontology of the desired data set:
	- Data classification
		* Deciding what/which data to store.
	- Identifying the relationships between the data.
+ The types of ontology are:
	- domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology)
	- upper ontology (or foundation ontology)
		* A model of common objects, and common relationships between these
			objects, that can be applies to a set of domain ontologies.
	- hybrid ontology
		* A combination of domain ontology and upper ontology.
	- Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)
		* ontology visualization techniques
		* ontology engineering (or ontology building), part of knowledge
			engineering

##	Database Models


##	Categories of Databases

###	Object Databases



###	SQL

Relational databases
+
+ relational database management systems
	- database servers
		* MySQL
		* PostgreSQL
			+ Supports ODBC
		* SQLite
		* Firebird (database server)
	- database clients
		* SQuirrel SQL client



###	NoSQL

####	Key-Value Store

####	NoSQL Database Management Systems

+ HBase
+ Cassandra
+ MongoDB



Document-oriented database (= document store)
+ Use document-oriented information (= semi-structured data)
+ Examples:
	- XML database

###	NewSQL




##	Distributed Databases for Big Data


+ Hive
+ Spark
+ Kafka
+ Flume


Apache Ignite???


###	Distributed Databases Based on MapReduce

Apache Hadoop (and HDFS):
+ Pig




##	Database Data Formats

Data formats for databases \cite{WikipediaContributors2018r}:
+ SQL
+ ODBC, Open Database Connectivity \cite{WikipediaContributors2018t}
	- API to access DBMS
	- There exists ODBC-to-JDBC (ODBC-JDBC) and JDBC-to-ODBC
		(JDBC-to-ODBC) bridges
+ JDBC, Java Database Connectivity.
	- API based on *Java* to access/modify a database
		\cite{WikipediaContributors2018s}.
+ GDA, GNU Data Access \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a5}
	- *GNOME-DB* is a *GNOME*-based database management systems.
	- It supports access to persistent data (in databases).
	- GDA, GNU Data Access, is its data management API.
		* Compared to JDBC and ODBC, it provides a larger set of
			features, and is considered as a complete architecture
			for databases.
		* "*Libgda* is a database access library", which serves
			as a database and abstraction layer.


Use ODBC, JDBC, and GDA wrappers for database management systems
	of my choice \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a5}.
