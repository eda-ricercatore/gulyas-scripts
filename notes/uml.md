#	Notes About *Unified Modeling Language*

This document is my summary, or cheat sheet, about the Unified Modeling
	Language (UML).


##	Class Diagrams

In UML, the class diagram statically represents the software architecture of a
	software.

The class diagram depicts the elements, such as classes and packages, and the
	static relationships (not dynamic interactions) between them
	\cite{WikipediaContributors2018d}.

For each class in the class diagram, it has three compartments that are described
	as follows \cite{WikipediaContributors2018d}: 
+ top compartment
	- Name of the class
	- Center aligned
	- In bold font
	- Captialize the first letter of each word
		* If the class name is a concatenation of words, the first letter of each
			word in this concatenation shal be capitalized.
		* That is, write the first letter of each word in upper case.
			\cite{WikipediaContributors2018g}.
		* Or, use the camel case \cite{WikipediaContributors2018f,WikipediaContributors2018g}.
		* Or, use the Hungarian notation \cite{WikipediaContributors2018e}.
+ middle compartment
	- Class attributes.
	- Left aligned.
	- Write each attribute (entirely) in lower case \cite{WikipediaContributors2018g}.
		* Use of the snake case is strongly recommended \cite{WikipediaContributors2018g}.
+ bottom compartment
	- Operations (i.e., functions or methods) that "the class can execute."
	- Left aligned.
	- Write each operation (entirely) in lower case \cite{WikipediaContributors2018g}.
		* Use of the snake case is strongly recommended \cite{WikipediaContributors2018g}.

Additional notes about classes:
+ A class member is an attribute or method/operation of a given class
	 \cite{WikipediaContributors2018d}.





Visibility of class members \cite{WikipediaContributors2018d}:
+ "+": public
+ "-": private
+ "#": protected
+ "/": derived
+ "~": package
+ "\*": random
















###	Visibility and Scope of Class members



###	Types of instance-level relationships

+ dependency
+ association
+ aggregation
+ composition

Difference between compoition and aggregation:

+ 







###	Class-level relationships

+ generalization/inheritance
+ realization/implementation
+ general relationship
	- dependency
	- multiplicity






###	Analysis of stereotypes
