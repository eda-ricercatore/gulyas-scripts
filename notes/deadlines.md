		* Dynamic logic, foundations and applications
		* Logics with regular modalities
		* Modal/temporal/epistemic logics
		* Kleene and action algebras and their variants
		* Quantum dynamic logic
		* Coalgebraic modal/dynamic logics
		* Graded and fuzzy dynamic logics
		* Dynamic logics for cyber-physical systems
		* Dynamic epistemic logic
		* Complexity and decidability of variants of dynamic logics and temporal logics
		* Model checking, model generation and theorem proving for dynamic logics
		* Building on the pioneer intuitions of Floyd-Hoare logic, dynamic logic was introduced in the 70's as a suitable logic to reason about, and verify, classic imperative programs. Since then, the original intuitions grew to an entire family of logics, which became increasingly popular for assertional reasoning about a wide range of computational systems. Simultaneously, their object (i.e. the very notion of a program) evolved in unexpected ways. This lead to dynamic logics tailored to specific programming paradigms and extended to new computing domains, including probabilistic, continuous and quantum computation. Both its theoretical relevance and practical potential make dynamic logic a topic of interest in a number of scientific venues, from wide-scope software engineering conferences to modal logic specific events. However, no specific event is exclusively dedicated to it. This workshop aims at filling fill such a gap, joining an heterogeneous community of colleagues, from Academia to Industry, from Mathematics to Computer Science.
		* On Free ω-Continuous and Regular Ordered Algebras
			+ Ordered algebras abound in program logics and programming language semantics: ω-continuous semirings, star-continuous Kleene algebras and Kleene algebras with tests, context-free languages, OI-macro languages, iteration theories, recursion schemes, and Scott domains, among many others. These structures are all examples of varieties of ordered Σ-algebras with restricted completeness and continuity properties. In this talk I will give a general characterization of the free algebras of such varieties in terms of submonads of the monad of Σ-coterms. Varieties of this form are called quasi-regular. For example, the free star-continuous Kleene algebra is the subalgebra of the corresponding free ω-continuous semiring determined by those elements denoted by the regular Σ-coterms, where Σ is the signature of Kleene algebra. This is a special case of a more general construction that applies to any quasi-regular family, including all the examples mentioned above. The talk report on joint work with Zoltán Ésik.

			+ security
		* QEST welcomes a diversity of modelling formalisms, programming languages and methodologies that incorporate quantitative aspects such as probabilities, temporal properties and other forms of non-determinism. This includes work on the combination of quantitative evaluation and verification with machine learning techniques. Papers may advance empirical, simulation and analytic methods.
		* Systems of interest include computer hardware and software architectures, communication systems, cyber-physical systems, infrastructural systems, security systems and biological systems.
	- QEST considers five types of papers:
		+ Theoretical: advance our understanding, apply to non-trivial problems and be mathematically rigorous.
		+ Methodological and technical: describe situations that require the development and proposal of new analysis processes and techniques.
		+ Application: describes a novel application, and compares with previous results.
		+ Tools: should motivate the development of the new tools and the formalisms they support, with a focus on the software architecture and practical capabilities.
		+ Tool demonstration: describe a relevant tool, as well as its features, evaluation, or any other information that may demonstrate the merits of the tool.

			+ System  security  and  privacy:IoT  security,  embedded  systems  security,  hardware  security  and trust, physically unclonable functions, random number generators, machine learning assisted side channel analysis, machine learning for detection of side channel attacks, malware, etc.
			+ Machine   learning   for   security:machine   learning   techniques,   cognitive   systems,   artificial intelligence, adversarial learning, fault tolerance of AI, robust AI, secure hardware implementations of cryptographic functions
			+ Applications and case studies:FPGA security, smart autonomous systems, security- and privacy- aware data  analytics,  design for safety and  certifications  in airborne,  health care, automotive  and IoT applications, FPGA accelerators for analytics on encrypted data.
			+ We interact with a large variety of computing systems in our daily life. These computing systems are connected  through  the  network  to  provide  a  wide  array  of  services.  Depending  on  our  specific circumstances,  our interactions  can  be  with  embedded  and  cyber-physical  systems  or  Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. While these devices vary in terms of form factors, performance, and energy constraints, for all these devices, security and privacy issues have come to the forefront of design considerations. These systems  collect  and  analyze  our  personal,  financial  as  well  as  health  information  on  a  regular  basis.Consequently, research and development efforts in academia and industry have been increasingly focusing on designing systems  with security and privacy in mind. Given the  complexity of these systems and the diversity  of  the  potential  attacks,  machine  learning  has  become  an  attractive  solution  for  security and privacy  analytics.  It  has  made  its  mark  for  detecting  known  software,  firmware  as  well  as  hardware vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have also highlighted the need for design automation techniques to ensure that the implementation of machine learning algorithms is robust against faults and side channels to enhance the overall system security.
			+ This special issue is about security challenges and solutions  with emerging computing technologies, including circuit design, architecture, automation and studies on vulnerabilities.
			+ Multiple emerging computing technologies, based on, e.g., Graphene, Spintronics, Resistive  RAM, Quantum  Computing and  others are being developed to enhance the capabilities of logic  devices and circuits. The rapid growth in these technologies  is synchronized with the decline of Moore's law, and thus promises to herald the era of Beyond  CMOS  technologies  with a significant improvement in energy-efficiency, reliability,  performance  and  manufacturability. These devices enable very  different computing paradigms, e.g., neuromorphic computing, non-Boolean computing, and in-memory computing, thus making these platforms an interesting playground for circuit, and application-developers alike.
			* For example, several of these devices are opening up new information side channels, which  require  careful  analysis  before  using  those  as  implementation  platforms  for cryptographic  primitives.  From  another  perspective,  phenomenon  like  cross-talk  in these devices can threaten well-founded counter-measures like masking which assume independence  of  the  mask  values.  Likewise,  fault  tolerance  of  these  devices  in  the context of security needs a fresh evaluation. On the other hand, for many practical use cases  like  IoT/CPS, and  emerging  cryptographic  standards  like  post-quantum cryptography, the  security kernels and  countermeasures  need  to  be  designed  with stringent constraints on area/energy footprints. Therefore, identifying suitable design choices and adapting them to different applications in the IoT/CPS context is a need of the  hour.  In  essence,  both  the  design  and  attack  paradigms  for  secure  systems  are blended with the emergence of new computing technologies, which will be covered in this special issue.
			+ Security Kernel Design:
				- Device/Circuit perspectives, co-design for emerging  technologies for security systems

				- Practical Implementations and Case Studies using emerging technologies for security applications
				- Novel technology/circuit-level Attack Resistance Mechanisms
				- Chain-of-Trust Design in Emerging Computing Technologies
				- Fundamental enhancements in neuromorphic computing to support security/trust mechanism design
			+ Quantum-Enabled  Attacks, Modeling Attacks, Information Leakage and Side-Channel Attack:
				- New passive/active side channel attacks on circuits built using emerging computing technologies
				- Modeling of Information Leakage for emerging computing technologies and Side-Channel Attacks
				- Fault attacks for emerging technologies using novel equipment

	- "The Journal of Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems invites submissions of original technical papers describing research and development in emerging technologies in computing systems. Major economic and technical challenges are expected to impede the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. This has resulted in the search for alternate mechanical, biological/biochemical, nanoscale electronic, asynchronous and quantum computing and sensor technologies. As the underlying nanotechnologies continue to evolve in the labs of chemists, physicists, and biologists, it has become imperative for computer scientists and engineers to translate the potential of the basic building blocks (analogous to the transistor) emerging from these labs into information systems. Their design will face multiple challenges ranging from the inherent (un)reliability due to the self-assembly nature of the fabrication processes for nanotechnologies, from the complexity due to the sheer volume of nanodevices that will have to be integrated for complex functionality, and from the need to integrate these new nanotechnologies with silicon devices in the same system."
	- The journal provides comprehensive coverage of innovative work in the specification, design analysis, simulation, verification, testing, and evaluation of computing systems constructed out of emerging technologies and advanced semiconductors. Topics include, but are not limited to:

###	Journals for Computational Engines

+ ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA):
	- The first publication devoted entirely to experimental work in algorithms and data structures
	- The Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (ISSN 1084-6654) is a high-quality journal devoted to the study of discrete algorithms and data structures from an empirical perspective. The journal welcomes original submissions that focus on design, implementation, and performance evaluation through a combination of experimentation and classical techniques.
		* JEA joins [RCR: Replicated Computational Results Initiative](https://jea.acm.org/rcr_initiative.cfm)
		* Authors of articles nearly-accepted in JEA will now be invited to apply for an RCR certificate attached to their article. For those that accept, a further reviewer will be appointed to ensure that their experimental results can be replicated. The RCR initiative aims to improve the reproducibility of experimental results in the community and adds to the trustability of the experimental results in the articles published in JEA. For more details see RCR Initiative page.
		* RCR review process: We expect that this extra reviewing will be light and will not noticeably extend the reviewing period, as it will run in parallel with the last stages of standard reviewing (the referee will communicate with the authors directly via email). The Reproducibility Referee may advise the authors on what additional information to add in the article in order to let readers reproduce the results faithfully. Reacting to this advice works in the same way as with standard referees: the parties iterate until the referee is satisfied. Ultimately, this referee will declare whether or not the computational results in the manuscript are reproducible.
		* Methods for replicating results: We rely on the expertise of the Reproducibility Reviewer to make the final determination of the designation. Presently we have two basic approaches for assessing replicability. The first is more desirable, but not always possible.
		* Independent replication: The authors provide the RCR reviewer access to, or sufficient description of, the computational platform used to produce the manuscript results. Access could be:
			+ A direct transfer of software to the reviewer or a pointer to an archive of the software, and a description of a commonly available computer system the reviewer can access.
			+ A guest account and access to the software on the system used to produce the results.
			+ Detailed observation of the authors replicating the results.
		* To prepare the data for the review process, the authors must send to the designated Reproducibility Reviewer:
			+ A repository which includes the relevant source code.
			+ A readme file which describes how to run the experiments.
			+ A script which triggers all experiments (e.g., generates or downloads necessary input files, compiles the programs, runs the experiments, and generates data and tables/figures).
			+ An assignment of generated tables/figures (possibly also in the readme file) to tables/figures in the accepted paper.
		* Review of computational results artifacts: In some situations, authors may not be able to readily replicate computational results. Results may be from a system that is no longer available, or may be on a leadership class computing system to which access is very limited. In these situations, careful documentation of the process used to produce results could be sufficient for an RCR designation. In this case, the software should have its own substantial verification process to give the reviewer confidence that computations were performed correctly. If timing results are reported, the authors' artifacts should include validation testing of the timers used to report results.
	- To stimulate research in algorithms based upon implementation and experimentation; in particular, to encourage testing, evaluation and reuse of complex theoretical algorithms and data structures.
	- To distribute programs and testbeds throughout the research community and to provide a repository of useful programs and packages to both researchers and practitioners.
	- The ACM JEA was established to address the following issues:
		* The empirical study of combinatorial algorithms is a rapidly growing research area, with no proper outlet for publication.
		* Communication among researchers in this area must include more than a summary of results or a discussion of methods; the actual programs and data used are of critical importance.
		* Many published algorithms and data structures have never been implemented by anyone and are at risk of remaining theoretical "curiosities.'' To bring such algorithms and data structures into the practical realm often requires considerable sophistication; researchers need to be encouraged to turn their talents in that direction.
		* Most researchers find that they must program their own version of this or that well-known algorithm or data structure, because repositories for these are not available.
		* The two preceding reasons also explain why practitioners only rarely use state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures; a repository of routines, most with well documented behavior on realistic test cases, will encourage practitioners to use more recent results.
	- In addition, JEA aims to become a forum to distribute programs and testbeds throughout the research community and to provide a repository of useful programs and packages to both researchers and practitioners.
	- JEA welcomes research on algorithms and data structures for all sorts of practical computation models, including deterministic, randomized, approximate, online, parallel, distributed, streaming, and external-memory. The following are some typical, but by no means exclusive, application areas:
		* combinatorial optimization
		* computational biology
		* computational geometry
		* graph manipulation
		* integer arithmetic and cryptography
		* machine learning and AI
		* management of massive datasets
		* routing and scheduling
		* searching and sorting
		* string processing
		* VLSI design
		* web search and information retrieval
