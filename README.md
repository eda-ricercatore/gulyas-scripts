# gulyas-scripts
This is the script directory for my research, as part of my dottorato di ricerca.

It contains scripts to test out ideas that I have read in research publications.

Names for repositories for my Ph.D. research shall be named after dishes and drinks from the [Hungarian cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_cuisine).

### Data Storage


Experimental data can be stored in (object-oriented) SQL databases,
	and source code documentation can be stored in NoSQL databases.







### Additional Information

The *Makefile*s are used for build automation. It is used to produce
	repeatable experiment results from the execution of a sequence of
		scripts and programs (including UNIX processes).







#	References

Citations/References that use the LaTeX/BibTeX notation are taken from my
	BibTeX database (set of BibTeX entries).

Additional references not found in the reference list shall be indicated below (TO BE UPDATED).
