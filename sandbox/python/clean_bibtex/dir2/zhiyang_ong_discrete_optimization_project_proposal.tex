\begin{abstract}
%	Problems in mathematical programming can be formulated as a conjunction of its objective function(s) and constraint(s), and solved with decision procedures for problems in maximum satisfiability modulo theories (Max-SMT) {\LARGE Insert Reference!!!}. This is because software for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) can reason on first-order logic formulae based the theories of nonlinear real and integer arithmetic, linear real and integer arithmetic, quantified first-order logic {\LARGE Insert Reference!!!}. For the class project of my ``Discrete Optimization'' class at National Taiwan University in Fall 2013, I propose developing a flow for discrete optimization based on Max-SMT solvers. The milestones for the class project are described as follows: encoding linear programming problems in standard form as SMT formulae, using the SMT-LIB 2 format {\LARGE Insert Reference!!!}, and solving the linear programming problems with existing open-source Max-SAT solvers (solvers for the maximum satisfiability problem, Max-SAT) {\LARGE Insert Reference!!!}; extend {\sc MiniSat} to solve problems in Max-SAT; evaluate current open-source SMT solvers (CVC4 and OpenSMT) {\LARGE Insert Reference!!!} for extension to Max-SMT; and, lastly, implement the extension of an SMT solver to Max-SMT. The last milestone would enable us to extend discrete optimization to discrete nonlinear programming (i.e., nonlinear integer programming) problems.

\section{Objectives of Study}
\label{sec:objectivesofstudy}

The objectives for our term project are: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item To investigate the use of solvers for Max-SAT and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) for mathematical programming. Specifically, we will focus on using Max-SAT and SMT solvers for linear programming (LP) and integer linear programming (ILP).
\item To explore meta-algorithms for discrete optimization; that is, we want to develop a framework for algorithmic portfolio optimization for LP and ILP problems.
\item Apply our algorithmic portfolio optimization framework to optimize radiation therapy planning. Radiation therapy is a treatment modality of cancer, and its planning process can take several days {\Huge Insert Reference!!!}. We want to considerably reduce this duration. In addition, for a given time period, decreasing the turnaround time for planning a particular radiation therapy can increase the number of patients that can be treated. This is because physicians can have more time for other patients, due to the time savings from using a more optimized radiation therapy planning procedure. Also, it can reduce patient cost, since each patient would incur less units of time from the team of physicians in the treatment process. Furthermore, it can reduce the workload on physicians and allied health professionals (e.g., nurses). {\Huge Insert Reference!!!}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Proposal}
\label{sec:summaryofliteraturesurvey}

We plan to implement existing procedures to solve LP and ILP problems using Max-SAT and SMT solvers. Subsequently, we will develop an algorithmic portfolio optimization framework for optimizing the planning process of radiation therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrently, 



The progress of modern SAT solvers can be shown in \cite[Fig. 1.2, pp. 5, Chapter 1]{Samulowitz2008} \cite[slide 7]{Sabharwal2011} \cite[slide 7]{Sabharwal2007}.

\cite[slide 9]{Ganesh2013}






The reference used was: \cite[\S2.5, pages 25--27]{Luenberger2008}. \\

The set of given constraints are:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{1} + \frac{8}{3}x_{2} \leq 4 \\
x_{1} + x_{2} \leq 2 \\
2x_{1} \leq 3 \\
x_{1} \geq 0, x_{2} \geq 0
\end{eqnarray*}



To solve this via a linear programming approach, use slack variables to convert the set of inequalities in $E^{2}$ to an equivalent set of equalities in $E^{5}$, where the five extreme points of the feasible set can be see in Figure \ref{fig:q1feasibleset} \cite[\S2.1, pages 12]{Luenberger2008}. \\

Thus, the resultant set of equalities, represented as $\mathbf{Ax = b}$ \cite[\S2.1, page 19]{Luenberger2008}, in the standard form \cite[\S2.1, pages 11]{Luenberger2008} of linear programming is given as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{1} + \frac{8}{3}x_{2} + x_{3} = 4 \\
x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{4} = 2 \\
2x_{1} + x_{5} = 3 \\
x_{1} \geq 0, x_{2} \geq 0, x_{3} \geq 0, x_{4} \geq 0, x_{5} \geq 0
\end{eqnarray*}

The basic solutions for this system of linear equations can be found by ``setting any two of variables to zero and solving for the remaining three'' \cite[\S2.5, page 26]{Luenberger2008}. \\

Possible Basic solution \#1:
Let $x_{1} = x_{2} = 0$, and the set of equalities become:
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 + \frac{8}{3} \times 0 + x_{3} = 4 \\
0 + 0 + x_{4} = 2 \\
2 \times 0 + x_{5} = 3 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, for possible basic solution \#1, $x_{1} = x_{2} = 0, x_{3} = 4, x_{4} = 2, x_{5} = 3$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} = \left[
	\begin{array}{c}
	0 \\ 0 \\ 4 \\ 2 \\ 3
	\end{array}
	\right]
\end{equation}

\section{Transforming Optimization Problem with Piecewise Linear Functions into Linear Programming Problem}
\label{sec:optimizationproblemtransformation}

The given mathematical optimization problem for a given class of piecewise linear functions is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f({\mathbf{x}}) = {\rm maximum} (\mathbf{c}^{T}_{1}\mathbf{x} + d_{1}, \mathbf{c}^{T}_{2}\mathbf{x} + d_{2}, \dots, \mathbf{c}^{T}_{p}\mathbf{x} + d_{p})
\end{eqnarray*}

For this I can convert it into a linear model by separating the $x_{i}$ and $d_{i}$ components, $\forall i \in {1, 2, ..., n}$
programming \cite[\S3.3, pages 83--86]{Haftka1992}\cite[\S1, pages 5-8]{Malucelli2005}. Add all the $x_{i}$ components and place them into the new objective function with the initial displacement $d_{1}$. For each additive/displacement term $d_{i}$ that causes the model to be piecewise linear, multiply it by a slack variables and constraint them within a range $d_{i}y_{i1} \leq z_{i} \leq d_{i}y_{i2}$ That is, re-formulate the problem as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f({\mathbf{x}}) = {\rm maximum} (d_{1}y_{1} + \mathbf{c}^{T}_{1}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{c}^{T}_{2}\mathbf{x} + \dots + \mathbf{c}^{T}_{p}\mathbf{x}) \\
{\rm subject\ to:} \\
%d_{2}y_{1a} \leq z_{1} \leq d_{1}y_{1b} \\
d_{2}y_{2a} \leq z_{2} \leq d_{2}y_{2b} \\
d_{3}y_{3a} \leq z_{3} \leq d_{3}y_{3b} \\
\dots \\
d_{p}y_{pa} \leq z_{p} \leq d_{p}y_{pb} \\
\end{eqnarray*}


Subsequently, I can convert the maximization problem in linear programming into a minimization problem if linear programming in the standard form \cite[\S3.4, page 48, Example 1]{Luenberger2008}. Negate ``the objective function'' to convert it to a minimization problem. For each constraint, add a unique slack variable to turn them into equalities in the standard form of linear programming.



The last milestone would enable us to extend discrete optimization to discrete nonlinear programming (i.e., nonlinear integer programming) problems.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
\label{sec:acknowledgments}

We received information about the problem formulation from Dr. Sani Nassif, who is a research staff member at IBM Research. He is mentoring us to optimize the radiation therapy planning process. \\

Mr. Prateek Tandon, who is a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, provided Zhiyang with some ideas for the class project, such as formulating the melody segmentation problem as a weighted interval scheduling problem and algorithmic portfolio optimization. The melody segmentation problem is about automatically segmenting songs into ``riffs''/melodies, and is a feature of the Lunar Tabs software project \cite{Tandon2012}. \\

Dr. Alexander Mitev, who is an embedded systems engineer, suggested transforming optimization problems that are NP-complete into a k-SAT problem ($\forall\ k > 2$) -- problem encoding in SAT, solve that k-SAT problem, and map the solution back to the problem domain (``SAT decoding'').
