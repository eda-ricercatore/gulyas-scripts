This is a sandbox, for trying out different concepts with "throwaway" scripts, for *Python* scripts for:
+ [*BibTeX* database processing](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/clean_bibtex)
	- superceded by an ongoing [*BibTeX* analytics project](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/bibtex-analytics)
+ [data structures, and data types](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/i-data-structures)
	- [enumerating multiple arrays concurrently](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/i-data-structures/enumerate_multiple_arrays-concurrently.py)
	- [enumerating ordered dictionaries, and lists of tuples (i.e., each list is a list tuples)](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/i-data-structures/ordered_dict_color_enumeration.py)
	- [performing operations on lists, using functional programming and otherwise](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/i-data-structures/performing_operations_on_lists.py)
		* includes an example on [list comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension), which is exploited in functional programming (for monad comprehension, set comprehension, dictionary comprehension, parallel list comprehension)
		* "List comprehension results in faster operations than explicit *for* loops"
+ [data visualization](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/b-visualization)
	- bar charts to compare experimental/simulation from different solutions for each category/benchmark
		* https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/b-visualization/barchart_3_groups.py
		* https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/b-visualization/barchart.py
+ [database management](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/database-management)
+ [error management and exception handling](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/h-error-management)
	- [printing error messages to standard error, and providing warning messages](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/h-error-management/e-print-error-output.py)
	- [exception handling](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/h-error-management/my_exception_handling.py)
+ [file input/output (I/O) operations](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/file-io)
+ [*Google Colab*, or *Google Colaboratory*](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/google-colab)
	- Uploading code
	- Importing pacakges and modules
		* from uploaded source code to *Google Drive*
		* from *Git*-based cloning of *GitHub* repositories.
+ [JSON file operations](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/json-files)
	- For operations with files using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
+ [linear algebra](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/linear_algebra)
+ [navigating file systems](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/a-navigating-file-systems)
	- enumerating subdirectories
	- [operations involving file extensions](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/a-navigating-file-systems/a_os_path_methods.py)
+ [*Python* functions](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/tree/master/sandbox/python/e-functions)
	- [*Python* functions that return multiple values](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/sandbox/python/e-functions/function_multiple_return_values.py)
