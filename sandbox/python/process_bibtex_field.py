"""
	This Python script is written by Zhiyang Ong to process lines in
		BibTeX databases.
	A BibTeX database is a set of BibTeX entries.
	A BibTeX entry has a set of BibTeX fields, which may include the
		non-standard "Bdsk-Url-1" or "Bdsk-Url-2" BibTeX field.

	There exists no backup URL BibTeX field apart from the
		aforementioned two backup URL BibTeX fields.

	What works in this file will be used in my clean_BibTeX repository
		of Python scripts to "clean" my BibTeX databases of metadata,
		and non-standard BibTeX fields.

	This script can be executed as follows:
	./process_bibtex_field.py
